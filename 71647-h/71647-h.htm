  <h2 id='chap07' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seven'>VII</abbr> <br> POST-CHRISTIAN GNOSTICS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It will be seen, from what has been said in the first
volume, that, even at the beginning of the Christian era,
there was no lack of αἵρεσις or choice of creeds offered to
those peoples of the Levant who had outgrown their national
religions; and it may be a surprise to many that more notice
was not taken by the Christians of the Apostolic age of
these early essays at a universal faith. Some writers, indeed,
among whom Bishop Lightfoot is perhaps the most notable,
have thought that they could detect allusions to them in the
Canonical writings, and that by the “worshipping of angels,
intruding into those things which man hath not seen, vainly
puffed up by the understanding of his flesh<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>” which <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul
condemns in the Epistle to the Colossians, must be understood
the teachings of Gnostic sects already in existence<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Others
have gone further, and think that the Fourth Gospel was itself
written under Gnostic influence<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and that the Apocalypse
attributed to the same author vituperates under the name of
the Nicolaitans a Christian sect professing Gnostic tenets<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
Even if this be so, however, the comparatively late date assigned
to all these documents<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> must prevent their being received as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>evidence of what happened in the earliest stage of the Christian
Church; and we find no proof that Gnosticism ever seriously
competed for popular favour with orthodox Christianity until
well into the <abbr title='second'><span class='fss'>II</span>nd</abbr> century<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a>. That the first Christians would take
little heed either of organized religions like that of the Alexandrian
divinities, or of the speculations of the Orphic poets
and of such sects as the Simonians is plain, when we consider
the way in which their expectation of the Parusia or Second
Coming dominated every moment of their lives<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. They believed
with the unquestioning faith of children that their dead Master
would presently return to the earth, and that it would then be
destroyed to make way for a new state of things in which, while
the majority of mankind would be condemned to everlasting
fire, His followers should taste all the joys of Paradise. With
this before their eyes, they turned, as has been said, their
possessions into a common fund<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a>, they bound themselves
together in a strict association for mutual help and comfort,
and they set to work to sweep their fellows into the Christian
fold with an earnestness and an energy that was the fiercer
because the time for its exercise was thought to be so short.
“The Lord is at hand and His reward,” a saying which seems
to have been a password among them<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a>, was an idea never
absent from their minds, and the result was an outburst of
proselytism such as the world till then had never seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They saw,” says a writer who was under no temptation to exaggerate
the charity and zeal of the primitive Church, “their fathers
and mothers, their sisters and their dearest friends, hurrying onward to
that fearful pit, laughing and singing, lured on by the fiends whom
they called the gods. They felt as we should feel were we to see a
blind man walking towards a river bank.... Who that could hope
to save a soul by tears and supplications would remain quiescent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>as men do now?.... In that age every Christian was a missionary.
The soldier sought to win recruits for the heavenly host;
the prisoner of war discoursed to his Persian jailer; the slave girl
whispered the gospel in the ears of her mistress as she built up the
mass of towered hair; there stood men in cloak and beard at street
corners who, when the people, according to the manners of the day,
invited them to speak, preached, not the doctrines of the Painted
Porch, but the words of a new and strange philosophy; the young
wife threw her arms round her husband’s neck and made him agree
to be baptised, that their souls might not be parted after death<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a>....”</p>

<p class='c010'>How could people thus preoccupied be expected to concern
themselves with theories of the origin of a world about to perish,
or with the philosophic belief that all the gods of the nations
were but varying forms of one supreme and kindly power?</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the end of the <abbr title='first'><span class='fss'>I</span>st</abbr> century, however, this belief in
the immediate nearness of the Second Coming had died away<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
The promise that the second Gospel puts into the mouth of
Jesus that some of His hearers should not taste of death until
they saw the Son of Man come with power<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a>, had become incapable
of fulfilment by the death of the last of those who had
listened to Him. Nor were all the converts to the faith which
His immediate disciples had left behind them possessed with the
same simple faith and mental equipment as themselves<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. To
the poor fishermen and peasants of Judaea had succeeded the
slaves and freedmen of great houses—including even Caesar’s
own,—some of them professionally versed in the philosophy of
the time, and all with a greater or less acquaintance with the
religious beliefs of the non-Jewish citizens of the great Roman
Empire<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. The preachings and journeys of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul and other
missionaries had also brought into the Christian Church many
believers of other than Jewish blood, together with the foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>merchants and members of the Jewish communities scattered
throughout the Roman world, who were better able than the
Jews of Palestine to appreciate the stability and the organized
strength of the Roman Empire and to desire an alliance with
it. To ask such men, deeply engaged as many of them were
in the pursuit of wealth, to join in the temporary communism
and other-worldliness practised by the first Christian Church
would have been as futile as to expect the great Jewish banking-houses
of the present day to sell all that they have and give
it to the poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another cause that profoundly altered the views of the early
Christian communities must have been the catastrophe and final
dispersion of the Jewish nation. Up to the time of the destruction
of the Temple of Jerusalem under Titus, the Christians
not only regarded themselves as Jews<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a>, but were looked upon
by such of the other subjects of Rome as had happened to have
heard of them, as merely one sect the more of a race always
factious and given to internal dissensions. Yet even in <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr>
Paul’s time, the Christians were exposed to a bitter persecution
at the hands of those orthodox Jews who seemed to the Gentile
world to be their co-religionists<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a>, and it is probable that in
the outbreak of fanaticism attending the first Jewish war,
they suffered severely at the hands of both combatants<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. The
burning of the Temple must also have been a crushing blow
to all who looked for a literal and immediate fulfilment of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Messianic hope, and its result was to further accentuate the
difference between the Christians and the Jews<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. Moreover, the
hatred and scorn felt by these last for all other members of
the human race had now been recognized by the Gentiles<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, and
the repeated insurrections attempted by the Jews between the
time of Titus and the final war of extermination under Hadrian
showed that these feelings were shared by the Jewish communities
outside Palestine<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a>. It was therefore not at all the time
which worldly-wise and prudent men, as many of the later
Christian converts were, would choose for identifying themselves
with a race which not only repudiated the relationship in the
most practical way, but had lately exposed themselves on other
grounds to the deserved execration of the civilized world.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, then, by no means surprising that some of the new
converts should have begun to look about them for some
compromise between their recently acquired convictions and
the religious beliefs of the Graeco-Roman world in which they
had been brought up, and they found this ready to their hand
in the pre-Christian sects which we have ventured above to
class together under the generic name of Gnostic. In the
Orphic poems, they found the doctrine of successive ages of
the world, each with its different characteristics, which coincided
well enough with the repeated declaration of the Christians
that the old world was passing away,—as was indeed the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>since the conquests of Alexander<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a>. They found, too, both in
the Orphic poems and in the mixed religions like that of the
Alexandrian divinities which had sprung from the doctrines
taught by these poems, the legend of a god dying and rising
again for the salvation of mankind told in a way which had
many analogies with the Gospel narratives of the Passion and
Resurrection of Jesus<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a>. Among the Essenes, too, who may have
owed, as has been said above, some of their doctrines to Orphic
inspiration, they found all the modest virtues of sobriety,
chastity, and mutual help which had already distinguished the
Christian Church above all the other religious associations of
the time. And among both the Orphics and the Essenes was
to be noticed the strained and fanciful system of interpretation
by allegory and figure which enabled them to put their own
construction upon the words not only of the books of the Jewish
Canon, but of those writings which had begun to circulate
among the scattered Christian communities as containing the
authentic teaching of Jesus and His immediate disciples<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a>. Add
to this that the Simonians, and no doubt other pre-Christian
Gnostic sects of which we have lost all trace, had already shown
the mixed populations of the Levant how to reconcile the
innovations of a teacher of impressive and commanding
personality with their own ancestral traditions<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a>, and that the
many mysteries then diffused throughout the ancient world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>offered a ready means of propagating new doctrines under
cover of secrecy; and it will be seen that most of the sources
from which the founders of the great post-Christian sects
afterwards drew their systems were then lying open and ready
to hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prize which awaited success was, moreover, no mean one.
It is sometimes said that the only distinction that awaited a
leader of the Church at this time was the distinction of being
burned alive<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a>. Yet the fear of impeachment to be followed by
a still more horrible death never prevented English statesmen
in the <abbr title='seventeenth'><span class='fss'>XVII</span>th</abbr> century from struggling with each other for place
and power; while the State had not as yet made any serious
attempt to suppress the propagation of Christianity by force.
On the other hand, a Christian bishop, even at this early date,
occupied a position which was really superior to that of most
functionaries of the secular State. Gifted with almost complete
power over his flock in temporal as well as in spiritual matters,
he was at once their judge and their adviser; and, so long as
there were Pagan emperors on the throne, the faithful were
forbidden to come to any tribunal but his<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a>. His judgments,
too, had a greater sanction than those of any temporal judge;
for while he could not indeed lawfully condemn any of his
hearers to death, he had in the sentence of excommunication
which he alone could pronounce, the power of cutting them off
from eternal life. The adoration with which he was regarded
by them also surpassed the respect paid to proconsul or legate<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a>;
and the literature of the time is full of allusions to the way in
which, when brought before the temporal rulers, he was attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>by weeping multitudes who crowded round him even in prison,
imploring his blessing and kissing his fetters<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a>. Hence it is not
to be wondered at that such a position was eagerly sought after,
that envy of the episcopate was the principal sin against which
the Christian writers of the sub-Apostolic age warned their
readers<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a>, and that it is to the disappointment at failing to
attain the highest places in the orthodox Church that they
ascribe the foundation of all the principal post-Christian sects<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.
Without taking this accusation as literally correct, it is plain
that the chance of irresponsible power over those whom
they could convince must have proved a most alluring bait to
religious-minded persons who were also ambitious and intellectual
men of the world<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it came about that during the <abbr title='second'><span class='fss'>II</span>nd</abbr> and <abbr title='third'><span class='fss'>III</span>rd</abbr> centuries,
there arose more than one teacher who set himself to construct
a system which should enable its votaries to retain the Hellenistic
culture which Alexander’s conquests had spread throughout the
whole civilized world with the religious and moral ideas which
the enthusiasm and energy of the first Christians had begun
to diffuse among the lower classes of citizens<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. Alexandria,
the natural meeting-place between the East and West, was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>doubt the scene of the first of these attempts, and the writings
of Philo, fortunately still extant, had already shown the way
in which the allegorical system of interpretation could be used
to this end. That many of the founders of post-Christian
Gnostic sects were Alexandrian Jews is the constant tradition
of the Christian Church, and is antecedently probable enough<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.
But other Gnostic leaders were certainly not Alexandrians and
came from centres sufficiently distant from Egypt to show that
the phenomenon was very widely spread, and that the same
causes produced the same results in the most distant places and
entirely outside the Jewish community. Marcion, the founder
of the Marcionite Church, was a native of Pontus. Saturnilus
or Saturninus—the name is spelt differently by Irenaeus and
Hippolytus—came from Antioch, Theodotus from Byzantium,
others, such as Cerdo, and probably Prepon the Syrian, began
teaching in Rome, while we hear of a certain Monoimus, who
is said to have been an Arab<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. Most of these are to us merely
names, only very brief summaries of the different systems
founded or professed by them having been preserved in the
heresiologies compiled by the Fathers of the Church both before
and immediately after the alliance of the Christian Church with
the Roman State under Constantine.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Of these treatises, the two, which, up to about sixty years
ago, formed our main sources of information with regard to
the Gnostics of the sub-Apostolic age<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, are the writings of
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons about the year 177 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, and of
Epiphanius, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, who tells us he wrote
in the seventh year of Gratian or 374 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> The first of these is
considerably later in date than the heresiarchs in refutation of
whose doctrines he wrote his five books “against Heresies”;
and although he is most probably honest in his account of their
tenets, it is evident that Irenaeus was incapable of distinguishing
between the opinions of the founders of the sects which he
controverts and those of their followers and successors. Epiphanius,
on the other hand, wrote when the Catholic Church
was already triumphant, and his principal object seems to have
been to blacken the memory of those competitors whom she
had already outdistanced in the race for popularity and power.
Hence he spares no pains to rake together every story which
theological hatred and unclean imagination had ever invented
against her opponents and rivals; while his contempt for consistency
and the rules of evidence show the intellectual depths to
which the war which orthodox Christianity had from the first
waged against Hellenistic culture had reduced the learning of the
age. The language in which he and the other Catholic writers
on heresy describe the Gnostics is, indeed, the first and most
salient instance of that intolerance for any other opinions than
their own, which a recent writer of great authority declares
the Apostles and their successors derived from their Jewish
nationality<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a>. “The first-born of Satan,” “seducers of women,”
“savage beasts,” “scorpions,” “ravening wolves,” “demoniacs,”
“sorcerers,” and “atheists” were the mildest terms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>which Epiphanius and his fellow heresiologists can bring
themselves to speak of the sectaries. They afford ample justification
for the remark of the philosophic Emperor Julian
that “no wild beasts are so hostile to men as Christian sects in
general are to one another<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From this lack of trustworthy evidence, the discovery in
1842 at a convent on <abbr title='Mount'>Mt</abbr> Athos of eight out of the ten books
of the <i>Philosophumena</i> now generally attributed to Hippolytus,
Bishop of “Portus Romana” in 230 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a>, seemed likely to
deliver us. The work thus recovered bore the title of the
<i>Refutation of all Heresies</i>, and did succeed in giving us a fairly
clear and coherent account of some twenty Gnostic sects, the
very existence of many of which was previously unknown to
us. Moreover, it went a good way beyond its predecessors in
pointing out that the real origin of all the heretical sects then
existing was to be found, not so much in the diabolic inspiration
which other writers thought sufficient to account for it, as in
the Pythagorean, Platonic, and other philosophies then in vogue,
together with the practice of astrology and magic rites which
had come to form an important part of all the Pagan religions
then popular. It also showed a very extensive and apparently
first-hand acquaintance with the works of the Gnostic leaders,
and the lengthy quotations which it gives from their writings
enable us to form a better idea than we had before been able
to do both of what the Gnostic tenets really were and of the
arguments by which they were propagated. Unfortunately the
text of the <i>Philosophumena</i> has not been able to withstand
the assaults of those textual critics who have already reduced
the Book of Genesis to a patchwork of several authors writing at
widely separate times and places, and writers like Dr. Salmon
and Prof. Stähelin have laboured to show that the author of
the <i>Philosophumena</i> was taken in by a forger who had himself
concocted all the documents which Hippolytus quotes as being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the work of different heresiarchs<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. Their conclusions, although
they do not seem to put the matter entirely beyond doubt,
have been accepted by many theological writers, especially in
Germany, and in the course of the discussion the fact has
emerged that the documents quoted can hardly go back to an
earlier date than the year 200 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c008'><sup>[40]</sup></a> It is therefore unlikely that
Hippolytus had before him the actual words of the heresiarchs
whom he is endeavouring to refute; and if the <i>Philosophumena</i>
were all we had to depend upon, we might despair of knowing
what “the great Gnostics of Hadrian’s time” really taught.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reason for this paucity of documents is also plain
enough. “The antidote to the scorpion’s bite,” to use a patristic
figure of speech<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c008'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, was felt by the early Church to be the actual
cautery, and its leaders spared no pains to rout out and burn
the writings of the heretics pending the time when they could
apply the same treatment to their authors. Even before their
alliance with Constantine had put the resources of the State
at their disposal, they had contrived to use the secular arm
for this purpose. In several persecutions, notably that of
Diocletian, which was probably the most severe of them all,
the Christian scriptures were particularly sought for by the
Inquisitors of the State, and many of the orthodox boasted that
they had arranged that the police should find the writings of
the heretics in their stead<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c008'><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Later, when it came to the turn
of the Christians to dictate imperial edicts, the possession of
heretical writings was made punishable with severe penalties<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c008'><sup>[43]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Between orthodox Christian and Pagan it is a wonder that
any have survived to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lucky chance, however, has prevented us from being
entirely ignorant of what the Gnostics had to say for themselves.
In 1851, a <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> which had been known to be in the British
Museum since 1778, was published with a translation into a
curious mixture of Latin and Greek by the learned Petermann,
and turned out to include a sort of Gospel coming from some
early Gnostic sect<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c008'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. From a note made on it by a writer who
seems to have been nearly contemporary with its scribes, it is
known as <i>Pistis Sophia</i> or “<i>Faith-Wisdom</i>”; and the same <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>
also contains fragments of other works coming from a cognate
source. In 1891, a papyrus in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
which had been brought into this country in 1769 by the
traveller Bruce, was also published with a French translation
by <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau, an ex-Abbé who has long made the later
Egyptian language his peculiar study, and proved to contain
two documents connected with the system disclosed in the
<i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c008'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. Both <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> are in Coptic of the dialect of the
Sahid or Upper Egypt, to which fact they probably owe their
escape from the notice of the Byzantine Inquisitors; and they
purport to contain revelations as to the next world and the
means of attaining salvation therein made by Jesus on His
return to earth after the Resurrection. Although these several
documents were evidently not all written at one time and place,
and cannot be assigned to a single author, the notes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>emendations appearing on the <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> show that most of them
must have been in the possession of members of the same school
as their composers; and that therefore we have here for the
first time direct and authentic evidence of the Gnostic tenets,
as put forward by their adherents instead of by their opponents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The collation of these documents with the excerpts from
other Gnostic writings appearing in early writers like Clement
of Alexandria who were not professed heresiologists<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c008'><sup>[46]</sup></a>, shows that
the post-Christian Gnostic sects had more opinions in common
than would be gathered from the statements of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Irenaeus,
Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, and that they probably fulfilled
a real want of the age<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c008'><sup>[47]</sup></a>. All of them seem to have held that
there was one Supreme Being, the source of all good, and that
matter was inherently malignant and opposed to him. All
of them, too, seem to have taught the perfectibility of man’s
nature, the salvation of at any rate the majority of mankind,
and the possibility of their rising in the scale of being; and all
of them held that this was to be effected mainly by means
of certain mysteries or sacramental rites which were assumed
to have a magical efficacy. All these fundamental characteristics
find their origin in the beliefs of the pre-Christian religions
and religious associations described above, and doubtless owed
much to their influence. But with these, there was now
combined for the first time the recognition of the divinity of
One who, while appearing upon earth as a man among men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>was yet thought by all to be endowed with a greater share of
the Divine nature than they. Orpheus, Moses, Homer, and the
Jewish prophets had in turn been claimed as religious teachers
who were divinely inspired; but Jesus was asserted by every
later Gnostic school of whose teachings we have any evidence
to have been Himself of higher essence and substance than the
rest of mankind<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c008'><sup>[48]</sup></a>. How far this assertion was dictated by the
necessity for finding a superhuman authority for the revelation
which each Gnostic leader professed to make to his disciples may
be open to question; but in view of some contemporary controversies
it is well to draw attention to the fact that the Divinity
in some shape or other of Jesus, as well as what is now called His
“historicity,” was never for a moment called in question during
the first three centuries by Gnostic or Catholic. Μονογενής
or <i>Monogenes</i><a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c008'><sup>[49]</sup></a>—a word which Catholic writers later confused
with Μονογεννητός or “only-begotten,” but which is best represented
by the corresponding Latin expression <i>unicus</i> or “unique”
(<i>i.e.</i> one of a kind)—is the word in which the Gnostics summed
up their conceptions of the nature of Jesus<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c008'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This belief, however, led to consequences which do not at
first sight seem to follow from it. The gods of classical antiquity
were indeed supposed to be of like passions with ourselves, and
the Greek of Homer’s time never thought it shame to attribute
to them jealousy or lust or fear or vanity or any other of the
weaknesses which afflict us<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c008'><sup>[51]</sup></a>. But the one feature besides their
beauty that distinguished the Greek gods from humanity was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>their immortality or freedom from death; and if demigods like
Heracles were said to have gone through the common experience
of mortals, this was held as proof that their apotheosis or
deification did not take place until they had left the earth<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c008'><sup>[52]</sup></a>.
So much was this the case that the Greeks are said to have
been much amused when they first beheld the Egyptians wailing
for the death of Osiris, declaring that if he were a god he could
not be dead, while if he were not, his death was not to be
lamented<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c008'><sup>[53]</sup></a>; and Plutarch, when repeating the story to his
countrymen, thought it necessary to explain that in his view
the protagonists in the Osiris and Set legend were neither gods
nor men, but “great powers” or daemons not yet deified and
in the meantime occupying a place between the two<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c008'><sup>[54]</sup></a>. The
same difficulty was, perhaps, less felt by the other Mediterranean
peoples, among whom, as we have seen, the idea of a god who
died and rose again was familiar enough<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c008'><sup>[55]</sup></a>; but the Gnostic
leaders must always have had before their eyes the necessity
of making Christianity acceptable to persons in possession of
that Hellenistic culture which then dominated the world, and
which still forms the root of all modern civilization. How,
then, were they to account for the fact that their God Jesus,
whether they considered Him as the Logos or Word of Philo,
or the Monogenes or Unique Power of the Supreme Being, had
suffered a shameful death by sentence of the Roman procurator
in Judaea?</p>

<p class='c007'>The many different answers that they gave to this question
showed more eloquently than anything else the difficulties with
which it was surrounded. Simon, according to Hippolytus,
said that Jesus only appeared on earth as a man, but was
not really one, and seemed to have suffered in Judaea, although
he had not really done so<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a>. Basilides the Egyptian, the leader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of another sect, held, according to Irenaeus, that the body of
Jesus was a phantasm and had no real existence, Simon of
Cyrene having been crucified in his stead<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c008'><sup>[57]</sup></a>; while Hippolytus,
who seems to have drawn his account of Basilides’ teaching
from a different source from that used by his predecessor,
makes him say that only the body of Jesus suffered and relapsed
into “formlessness<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c008'><sup>[58]</sup></a>,” but that His soul returned into the
different worlds whence it was drawn. Saturninus, another
heresiarch, held, according to both authors, to the phantasmal
theory of Jesus’ body, which attained such popularity among
other Gnostic sects that “Docetism,” as the opinion was called,
came to be looked upon by later writers as one of the marks
of heresy<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c008'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, and Hippolytus imagines that there were in existence
sects who attached such importance to this point that they
called themselves simply Docetics<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c008'><sup>[60]</sup></a>. Valentinus, from whose
teaching, as we shall see, the principal system of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> was probably derived, also adhered to this Docetic
theory, and said that the body of Jesus was not made of human
flesh, but was constructed “with unspeakable art” so as to
resemble it, the dove-like form which had descended into it
at His baptism leaving it before the Crucifixion<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c008'><sup>[61]</sup></a>. According
to Irenaeus, too, Valentinus held that the Passion of Jesus was
not intended as an atonement or sacrifice for sin, as the Catholics
taught, but merely as a symbol or reflection of something that
was taking place in the bosom of the Godhead<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c008'><sup>[62]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point in which the chief post-Christian Gnostic sects
seem to have resembled one another is the secrecy with which
their teachings were surrounded. Following strictly the practice
of the various mysteries—the Eleusinian, the Isiac, Cabiric, and
others—in which the Mediterranean god, whether called Dionysos,
Osiris, Attis, Adonis, or by any other name, was worshipped,
none were admitted to a knowledge of their doctrines without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>undergoing a long, arduous, and expensive course of initiation.
More than one Gnostic teacher is said to have told his hearers
to conceal from men what they were, or in other words not to
let it be known that they were affiliated to the sect<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c008'><sup>[63]</sup></a>, and all
the Fathers bear witness to the way in which in time of persecution
the Gnostics escaped by professing any faith that would
satisfy the Roman authorities. By doing so, they laid themselves
open to the accusation hurled at them with great virulence
by the Church, that their secret rites and doctrines were so
filthy as to shock human nature if made public—an accusation
which at the first appearance of Christianity had been brought
against the Catholics, and which the Church has ever since
made use of against any sect which has differed from her,
repeating it even at the present day against the Jews and the
Freemasons<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c008'><sup>[64]</sup></a>. There is, however, no reason why the accusation
should be better founded in one case than in the others; and
it is plain in any event that the practice of secrecy when
expedient followed directly from the magical ideas which have
been shown above to be the foundation of the dogmas of
all the pre-Christian Gnostics, besides permeating religions
like that of the Alexandrian divinities. The willingness of the
post-Christian Gnostics to subscribe to any public profession of
faith that might be convenient was no doubt due to the same
cause<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c008'><sup>[65]</sup></a>. As has been well said, to the true Gnostic, Paganism,
Christianity, and Mahommedanism are merely veils<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a>. The
secret words and formulas delivered, and the secret rites which
the initiate alone knows, are all that is necessary to assure him
a distinguished place in the next world; and, armed with these,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>he can contemplate with perfect indifference all outward forms
of worship.</p>

<p class='c007'>These and other points which the post-Christian Gnostic
sects seem to have had in common<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a> can therefore be accounted
for by their common origin, without accepting the theory of
the textual critics that the Fathers had been deceived by an
impostor who had made one document do duty several times
over. Yet until we have the writings of the heresiarchs actually
in our hands, we must always be in doubt as to how far their
opinions have been correctly recorded for us. The post-Christian
Gnostic sects have been compared with great aptness
to the Protestant bodies which have sprung up outside the
Catholic Church since the German Reformation<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c008'><sup>[68]</sup></a>, and the
analogy in most respects seems to be perfect. Yet it would
probably be extremely difficult for a bishop of the Church of
Rome or of that of England to give within the compass of an
heresiology like those quoted above an account of the tenets
of the different sects in England and America, without making
grave and serious mistakes in points of detail. The difficulty
would arise from want of first-hand knowledge, in spite of the
invention of printing having made the dissemination of information
on such subjects a thousand times more general than in
sub-Apostolic times, and of the fact that the modern sects,
unlike their predecessors, do not seek to keep their doctrines
secret. But the analogy shows us another cause of error. The
“Free Churches,” as they are called in modern parlance, have
from the outset shown themselves above all things fissiparous,
and it is enough to mention the names of Luther, Zwingli,
Calvin, Socinus, Wesley, and Chalmers to show how hopelessly
at variance the teachings of the founders of sects at first sight
are. But in spite of this, there seems to have been always
a sort of fluidity of doctrine among them, and hardly any of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the Nonconformist sects now profess the dogmas with which
they first came into existence. The changes in this respect,
however, never involve the borrowing of new tenets from
sources external to them all, but seem to be brought about by
a sort of interfiltration between one sect and another. Thus,
for example, for many centuries after the Reformation the
majority of the dissident sects which rejected all connection
with the Catholic Church were among the stoutest defenders
of the Divinity of Jesus, and the Socinians who held the contrary
opinion were in an entirely negligible minority. At the present
day, however, the tendency seems to run the other way, and
many Nonconformist bodies are leaning towards Unitarian
doctrines, although few of them probably have ever heard the
name of Socinus. A similar tendency to interpenetration of
doctrines early showed itself among the Gnostics; and there
can be little doubt that it sometimes led to a fusion or amalgamation
between sects of widely differing origin. Hence it is
not extraordinary that certain tenets are sometimes recorded
by the Fathers as peculiar to one Gnostic leader and sometimes
to another, and to trace accurately their descent, it would be
necessary to know the exact point in the history of each sect
at which such tenets appeared. But the Fathers seldom thought
of distinguishing between the opinions of an heresiarch and
those of his successors, and the literary habits of the time were
not in favour of accurate quotation of documents or even of
names<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c008'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. This forms the chief difficulty in dealing with the
history of the Gnostic teaching, and although the discovery
of fresh documents contemporary with those we now possess
would undoubtedly throw additional light upon the subject,
it is probable that it will never be entirely overcome.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Generally speaking, however, Gnosticism played a most
important part in the history of Christianity. Renan’s view
that it was a disease which, like croup, went near to strangling
the infant Church is often quoted<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c008'><sup>[70]</sup></a>; but in the long run it is
probable that Gnosticism was on the whole favourable to her
development. In religion, sentiment often plays a larger part
than reason; and any faith which would enable men of weight
and influence to continue the religious practices in which they
had been brought up, with at the outset but slight modification,
was sure of wide acceptance. There seems no doubt that the
earlier Gnostics continued to attend the mysteries of the
Chthonian deities in Greece and of their Oriental analogues,
Osiris, Attis, Adonis, and the like elsewhere, while professing
to place upon what they there saw a Christian interpretation<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c008'><sup>[71]</sup></a>.
Here they acted like the little leaven that leaveneth the whole
lump, and this did much to spread the knowledge of the new
faith among those spiritually-minded Gentiles, who would never
have felt any interest in Christianity so long as it remained
merely a branch of Judaism<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c008'><sup>[72]</sup></a>. Most of them, moreover, sooner
or later abandoned their Gnosticism, and became practising
members of the Catholic Church, who sometimes went a long
way to meet them. As Renan has said, none of them ever
relapsed into Paganism<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c008'><sup>[73]</sup></a>, and in this way the so-called heresies
became at once the feeders of orthodox Christianity and its
richest recruiting-ground<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c008'><sup>[74]</sup></a>. They offered in fact an easy road
by which the wealthy, the learned, and the highly-placed could
pass from Paganism to Christianity without suffering the
inconvenience imposed upon the first followers of the Apostles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>On the other hand, it may be argued that the Church in
receiving such recruits lost much of that simplicity of doctrine
and practice to which it had hitherto owed her rapid and unvarying
success. The Gnostics brought with them into their
new faith the use of pictures and statues, of incense, and of all
the paraphernalia of the worship of the heathen gods. Baptism
which, among the Jewish community in which Christianity
was born, was an extremely simple rite, to be performed by
anybody and entirely symbolical in its character<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c008'><sup>[75]</sup></a>, became an
elaborate ceremony which borrowed the name as well as many
of the adjuncts of initiation into the Mysteries. So, too, the
Agape (love-feast) or common meal, which in pre-Christian
times was, as we have seen, common to all Greek religious
associations unconnected with the State, was transformed by
the Gnostics into a rite surrounded by the same provisions for
secrecy and symbolizing the same kind of sacrifice as those which
formed the central point of the mystic drama at Eleusis and
elsewhere. Both these sacraments, as they now came to be
called, were thought to be invested with a magical efficacy,
and to demand for their proper celebration a priesthood as
exclusive as, and a great deal more ambitious than, that of
Eleusis or Alexandria. The daring speculations of the Gnostics
as to the nature of the godhead and the origin of the world
also forced upon the Catholics the necessity of formulating her
views on these points and making adhesion to them a test of
membership<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c008'><sup>[76]</sup></a>. To do so was possibly to choose the smaller
of two evils, yet it can hardly be denied that the result of the
differences of opinion thus aroused was to deluge the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>with blood and to stay the progress of human knowledge for
more than a thousand years<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c008'><sup>[77]</sup></a>. It is said that if Gnosticism
had not been forcibly suppressed, as it was directly the Christian
priesthood obtained a share in the government of the State,
Christianity would have been nothing but a battle-ground for
warring sects, and must have perished from its own internal
dissensions. It may be so; but it is at least as possible that,
if left unmolested, many of the wilder sects would soon have
withered away from their own absurdity, and that none of the
others would have been able to endure for long. In this respect
also, the history of the post-Reformation sects offers an interesting
parallel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be that as it may, it is plain that the Catholic Church, in
devoting her energies to the suppression of the Gnostic heresies,
lost much of the missionary power which till then had seemed
all-conquering. During the two centuries which elapsed between
the siege of Jerusalem under Vespasian and the accession of
Aurelian, the Church had raised herself from the position of a
tiny Jewish sect to that of the foremost among the many
religions of the Roman Empire. A brief but bloody persecution
under Diocletian convinced the still Pagan Emperors of the
impossibility of suppressing Christianity by force, and the
alliance which they were thus driven to conclude with it enabled
the Church to use successfully against the Gnostics the arm
which had proved powerless against the Catholics<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c008'><sup>[78]</sup></a>. Yet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>triumph was a costly one, and was in its turn followed by a
schism which rent the Church in twain more effectually than
the Gnostic speculations could ever have done. In the West,
indeed, the Latin Church was able to convert the barbarians
who extinguished the Western half of the Roman Empire; but
in the East, Christianity had to give way to a younger and more
ardent faith. How far this was due to the means taken by the
Church to suppress Gnosticism must still be a matter of speculation,
but it is certain that after her first triumph over heresy
she gained no more great victories.</p>

  <h2 id='chap08' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eight'>VIII</abbr> <br> POST-CHRISTIAN GNOSTICS: THE OPHITES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Although the Ophites were one of the most widely-spread
and in some respects the most interesting of the heretical sects
which came to light after the foundation of the Christian
Church, we know nothing at first hand about their origin.
Philastrius, or Philaster of Brescia, writing about 380 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>,
includes them among those “who taught heresies before the
Coming of Christ<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c008'><sup>[79]</sup></a>”; but the phrase does not perhaps bear
its apparent meaning, and the late date at which he wrote
makes it unlikely that he possessed any exclusive evidence on
the point. A more plausible tradition, which is common to
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c008'><sup>[80]</sup></a>, to the tractate <i>Against All Heresies</i> which passes
under the name of Tertullian<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c008'><sup>[81]</sup></a>, and to the similar one attributed
to <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Jerome<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c008'><sup>[82]</sup></a>, is that the Ophites derived their doctrines from
Nicolaus or Nicolas of Antioch, the deacon mentioned in the
Acts<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c008'><sup>[83]</sup></a>, and that they are therefore alluded to under the name
of Nicolaitans<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c008'><sup>[84]</sup></a> in the address to the Church of Ephesus in the
Canonical Apocalypse. Origen, on the other hand, in his
<i>Discourse against Celsus</i> says that they boasted of one Euphrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>as their founder<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c008'><sup>[85]</sup></a>; while Hippolytus declares that their tenets
were said by themselves to be due to “the very numerous
discourses which were handed down by James the brother of
the Lord to Mariamne<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c008'><sup>[86]</sup></a>.” From which contradictory statements
we may gather that the “heresy” of the Ophites was,
even as early as 230 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, a very old one, which may have
appeared even before Christianity began to show its power,
and that it was probably born in Asia Minor and owed much
to the Pagan religions there practised and little or nothing
to any dominant personality as did the systems of Simon Magus
and the heresies treated of in the succeeding chapters.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also probable that between the time when the Canonical
Apocalypse was written and that of Origen and Hippolytus<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c008'><sup>[87]</sup></a>,
the Ophites altered their doctrines more than once. We may
not be able to go so far as their historian, Father Giraud, who
thinks that he can distinguish between their earlier opinions,
which he would attribute to the Naassenes or Ophites<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c008'><sup>[88]</sup></a> described
by Hippolytus, and those of a later school to which he would
assign the name of Ophites specially<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c008'><sup>[89]</sup></a>. Yet many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Fathers confuse their doctrines with those of the Sethians,
the Cainites, and other sects which seem to have had some
distinguishing features<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c008'><sup>[90]</sup></a>; while Hippolytus, who shows a more
critical spirit than the other heresiologists, says expressly that
the other heresies just named were little different in appearance
from this one, being united by the same spirit of error<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c008'><sup>[91]</sup></a>. The confusion
is further increased by his statement that the Naassenes
called themselves Gnostics, although Carpocrates’ followers, who
must have been later in time, are elsewhere said to be the first
to adopt this name<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c008'><sup>[92]</sup></a>. For there was at least one other sect
of heretics who did the same thing, and to whom Epiphanius
in his <i>Panarion</i> attributes, together with a theological and
cosmological system not unlike that hereafter described,
mysteries of unnameable obscenity with which the Ophites
were never charged<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c008'><sup>[93]</sup></a>. In this respect it may be as well to
remember the words of Tertullian that the heretics</p>

<p class='c009'>“know no respect even for their own leaders. Hence it is that
schisms seldom happen among heretics because, even when they
exist, they do not appear; for their very unity is schism. I am
greatly in error,” he continues, “if they do not amongst themselves
even diverge from their own rules, since every man, as it suits his
own temper, modifies the traditions he has received after the same
fashion as did he who handed them down to him, when he moulded
them according to his own free will.... What was allowed to
Valentinus is allowable to the Valentinians, and that is lawful for
the Marcionites which Marcion did, <i>i.e.</i> to innovate on the faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>according to his own judgment. In short, all heresies when investigated
are found to be in many particulars disagreeing with
their own authors<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c008'><sup>[94]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>If Tertullian was right, it is idle to expect that after the
lapse of nineteen centuries we can hope to distinguish between
the opinions of an heresiarch and those of his followers who
differed from or improved upon his teaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the country in which the Ophites first appeared, and
where to the last they had their strongest following, there can,
however, be little doubt. Phrygia, by which is meant the
entire central part of Asia Minor or, to use its modern name,
Anatolia, must from its situation have formed a great meeting-place
for different creeds, among which that of the Jews occupied
in the first centuries of our era a prominent place. Seleucus
Nicator had followed the example of Alexander in Egypt in
granting the Jews full rights of citizenship in all his cities,
and Antiochus the Great took even more practical steps towards
inducing them to settle there when he transported thither two
thousand Jewish families from Mesopotamia and Babylon<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c008'><sup>[95]</sup></a>.
These Jews of the Eastern Diaspora or Dispersion had, however,
by no means kept whole the faith of their forefathers, and there
seems in consequence to have been less racial hatred between
them and the earlier inhabitants of the country here than elsewhere<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c008'><sup>[96]</sup></a>.
In religious matters, these last, too, seem to have been
little affected by the Euhemerism that had destroyed the faith
of the more sophisticated Greeks, and the orgiastic worship of
Cybele, Attis, and Sabazius found in Phrygia its principal seat.
The tendency of the inhabitants towards religious hysteria was
not likely to be lessened by the settlement in the centre of
Asia Minor of the Celtic tribes known as the Galatae, who had
gradually passed under the Roman yoke in the time of Augustus,
but seem long to have retained their Celtic taste for innovations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in religious matters, and to have supplied from the outset an
endless number of heresies to the Church<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c008'><sup>[97]</sup></a>. Moreover, in the
Wars of Succession which followed the death of Alexander,
Phrygia had been bandied about like a shuttlecock between
Antigonus and Lysimachus; in the decadence of the Seleucid
house, it had been repeatedly harried by the pretenders to the
Syrian crown; and it had, during the temporary supremacy
of Mithridates and his son-in-law Tigranes, been subject to the
tyranny of the Armenians<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c008'><sup>[98]</sup></a>. Thanks to the policy of these
barbarian kings, it had in great measure been denuded of its
Greek-speaking inhabitants<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c008'><sup>[99]</sup></a>, the growth of its towns had been
checked, and the country seems to have been practically
divided among a crowd of dynasts or priest-kings, generally
the high-priests of temples possessing vast landed estates
and preserving their importance by the celebration of yearly
festivals. Dr Mahaffy compares these potentates with the
prince-bishops and lordly abbots produced by nearly the same
conditions in mediaeval Europe<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c008'><sup>[100]</sup></a>, and Sir William Ramsay’s
and Mr Hogarth’s researches of late years in Anatolia have
shown how much truth there is in the comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>The religion practised by these priest-kings throughout the
whole of Asia Minor differed slightly in form, but was one in
substance<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c008'><sup>[101]</sup></a>. It was in effect the worship of the bisexual and
mortal gods whom we have already seen worshipped under
varying names in the Eastern basin of the Mediterranean.
These deities, whose alternate appearance as male and female,
infant and adult, could only be explained to Western ears as
the result of incestuous unions, could all on final analysis be
reduced to one great divinity in whom all Nature was contained.
The essence of the Anatolian religion, says Sir William Ramsay,
when describing the state of things that existed in Phrygia
immediately before the preaching of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul, was</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“the adoration of the life of Nature—that life apparently subject
to death, yet never dying, but reproducing itself in new forms,
different and yet the same. This perpetual self-identity under
varying forms, this annihilation of death through the power of
self-reproduction, was the object of an enthusiastic worship, characterized
by remarkable self-abandonment and immersion in the
divine, by a mixture of obscene symbolism and sublime truths, by
negation of the moral distinctions and family ties that exist in a
more developed society, but do not exist in the free life of Nature.
The mystery of self-reproduction, of eternal unity amid temporary
diversity, is the key to explain all the repulsive legends and ceremonies
that cluster round that worship, and all the manifold
manifestations or diverse embodiments of the ultimate single divine
life that are carved on the rocks of Asia Minor<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c008'><sup>[102]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether the Phrygians of Apostolic times actually saw all
these sublime ideas underlying the religion of their country
may be doubted; but it is fairly certain that at the time in
question there was worshipped throughout Anatolia a divine
family comprising a goddess known as the Mother of the Gods,
together with a male deity, who was at once her son, her spouse,
her brother, and sometimes her father<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c008'><sup>[103]</sup></a>. The worship of this
pair, who were in the last resort considered as one bisexual
being, was celebrated in the form of festivals and mystery-plays
like those of the Middle Ages, in which the birth, nuptials,
death, and resurrection of the divinities were acted in dramatic
form. At these festivals, the worshippers gave themselves up
to religious excitement alternating between continence sometimes
carried to the extent of self-mutilation on the part of
the men, and hysterical or religious prostitution on the part
of the women<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c008'><sup>[104]</sup></a>. The gathering of foreign merchants and slaves
in the Anatolian cities, and the constant shifting of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>inhabitants by their successive masters, had forced on the
votaries of these Phrygian deities a <i>theocrasia</i> of the most
complete kind, and the Phrygian god and goddess were in turn
identified with the deities of Eleusis, of whom indeed they may
have been the prototypes, with the Syrian Aphrodite and Adonis,
with the Egypto-Greek Serapis and Isis, and probably with
many Oriental deities as well<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c008'><sup>[105]</sup></a>. At the same time, their fame
and their worship had spread far beyond Phrygia. The
primitive statue of the goddess of Pessinus, a black stone or
baetyl dignified by the name of the Mother of the Gods, was
transported to Rome in the stress of the Second Punic War
and there became the centre of a ritual served by eunuch priests
supported by the State<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c008'><sup>[106]</sup></a>; while, later, her analogue, the Syrian
goddess, whose temple at Hierapolis, according to Lucian,
required a <i>personnel</i> of over three hundred ministrants, became
the object of the special devotion of the Emperor Nero<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c008'><sup>[107]</sup></a>. As
with the Alexandrian divinities, the respect paid to these
stranger deities by the legions carried their worship into every
part of the Roman world<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c008'><sup>[108]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The element which the Jews of Asia contributed to Anatolian
religion at this period was probably more important than has
been generally supposed. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s theory that the epithet
of the “Highest” (Ὕψιστος) often applied to the God of Anatolia
and Syria really covers the personality of Yahweh of Israel
rests upon little proof at present<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c008'><sup>[109]</sup></a>. It may be conceded that
the tendency to monotheism—or to speak strictly their hatred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>for the worshippers of many gods—rooted in the Jews from the
Captivity onwards may at first have done much to hasten the
progress of the <i>theocrasia</i> which was welding all the gods of
the Mysteries into one great God of Nature. But the Babylonian
or Oriental Jews, called in the Talmud and elsewhere
the Ten Tribes, probably had some inborn sympathy with the
more or less exalted divinities of the West. Even in the temple
of Jerusalem, Ezekiel sees in his vision “women weeping for
Tammuz<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c008'><sup>[110]</sup></a>,” while Jeremiah complains of the Jews making cakes
to the Queen of Heaven, which seems to be another name for
the Mother of the Gods<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c008'><sup>[111]</sup></a>. The feminine side of the Anatolian
worship can therefore have come to them as no new thing.
Perhaps it was due to this that they so soon fell away from their
ancestral faith, and that, in the words of the Talmud, “the
baths and wines of Phrygia separated the Ten Tribes from
their brethren<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c008'><sup>[112]</sup></a>.” That their collection of money for the Temple
in Roman times was due not so much to any religious motive,
as to some of the financial operations in which the Jews were
always engaging, Cicero hints with fair plainness in his Oration
in defence of Flaccus<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c008'><sup>[113]</sup></a>. They seem, too, to have intermarried
freely with the Greek citizens, while the sons of these mixed
marriages did not undergo the circumcision which the Jews of
the Western Dispersion demanded not only from native Jews
but also from proselytes of alien blood<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c008'><sup>[114]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jews also brought with them into Phrygia superstitions
or side-beliefs to which they were probably much more firmly
attached than to their national religion. The practice of magic
had always been popular among the Chosen People as far back
as the time of Saul, and the bowls inscribed with spells against
enchantments and evil spirits form almost the only relics which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>they have left in the mounds which mark their settlement at
Hilleh on the site of the ancient Babylon<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c008'><sup>[115]</sup></a>. From this and
other evidence, it would seem that the Babylonian Jews had
borrowed from their Chaldaean captors many of their views as
to the importance of the Name in magic, especially when used
for the purposes of exorcism or of spells; that they thought
the name of their national god Yahweh particularly efficacious;
and that the different names of God used in the Old Testament
were supposed, according to a well-known rule in magic, to be
of greater efficiency as the memory of their meaning and actual
significance died out among them<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c008'><sup>[116]</sup></a>. The Babylonian Jews,
moreover, as is evident from the Book of Daniel, no sooner
found themselves among the well-to-do citizens of a great city
than they turned to the professional practice of divination and
of those curious arts whereby they could make a living from the
credulity of their Gentile neighbours without the manual labour
always dreaded by them<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c008'><sup>[117]</sup></a>. Hence Phrygia, like the rest of
Asia Minor during the Apostolic Age, was full of strolling
Jewish sorcerers who undertook for money to cast out devils,
to effect and destroy enchantments, to send and interpret
dreams, and to manufacture love philtres<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c008'><sup>[118]</sup></a>. That in doing so
they made great use of the name of their national deity seems
plain from Origen’s remark that “not only do those belonging
to the Jewish nation employ in their prayers to God and in the
exorcising of demons the words: God of Abraham and God of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Isaac and God of Jacob, but so also do most of those who occupy
themselves with magical rites. For there is found in treatises
on magic in many countries such an invocation of God and
assumption of the divine name, as implies a familiar use of it
by these men in their dealings with demons<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c008'><sup>[119]</sup></a>.” This is abundantly
borne out by the spells preserved for us by the Magic
Papyri before mentioned, where the expressions “God of
Abraham,” “God of Isaac,” “God of Jacob” constantly
occur. One spell given above contains, as we have seen,
along with many unfamiliar expressions drawn from Greek,
Persian, Egyptian, and even Sumerian sources, the words
“Blessed be the Lord God of Abraham<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c008'><sup>[120]</sup></a>,” and in nearly every
one do we find the Tetragrammaton or four-lettered name of
God transliterated in the <abbr class='spell'>A.V.</abbr> Jehovah, either with or without
some of the other Divine names used in the Old Testament.
The names of the angels Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael given
in the Old Testament and the Apocrypha are also common
in all this literature<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c008'><sup>[121]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did the Babylonian Jews bring with them into Phrygia any
theory of the universe other than the direct and unfettered
rule of Jehovah and the creation of the world from nothing,
which they gathered from their sacred books? There is little
evidence on the point, save some expressions of doubtful import
in the Magic Papyri<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c008'><sup>[122]</sup></a> and the statement of Origen that “the
name Sabaoth, and Adonai and the other names treated with
so much reverence among the Hebrews ... belong to a secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>theology which refers to the Framer of all things<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c008'><sup>[123]</sup></a>.” It might
be possible to deduce from this that the elaborate system known
as the Cabala or secret tradition of the Jews was already in
existence<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c008'><sup>[124]</sup></a>. This system, on its theoretical or speculative side,
attempts to explain the existence of the physical universe by
postulating a whole series of intermediate powers emanating
from the Supreme Being of whom they are the attributes or
names; while, on the other or “practical,” it professes to perform
wonders and to reveal mysteries by a childish juggling with
letters in the shape of anagrams and acrostics or with their
numerical values<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c008'><sup>[125]</sup></a>. As has been said above, follies of this last-named
kind were unknown neither to the later Orphics nor to
the primitive Church, and might well be thought to have been
acquired by the Jews during their stay in Babylon, where the
Semitic inhabitants seem from a very early date and for magical
reasons to have used numbers instead of letters in writing the
names of their gods<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c008'><sup>[126]</sup></a>. It would not have been difficult for them
to have acquired at the same time from the Persian masters
of Babylon the doctrine of emanation instead of creation which
is to be found in the Zend Avesta as well as in all the post-Christian
Gnostic systems. But there are other channels besides the
Anatolian religion through which these ideas might have come
into the West<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c008'><sup>[127]</sup></a>, and it will be better not to lay any stress upon
this. That the Cabala in the complete form in which it appears
in the books known as the <span lang="he"><i>Sepher Jetzirah</i></span> and the <span lang="he"><i>Sepher
Zohar</i></span> does not go further back than the <abbr title='sixth'><span class='fss'>VI</span>th</abbr> or <abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr> century
of our era, seems to be the opinion of all those best qualified
to judge in the matter. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Isidore Loeb, who has given the
most coherent and compact summary of Cabalistic teaching
that has appeared of late years, finds its germs in Babylonian
Judaism at about the same period which saw the blossoming of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the Christian Gnostic sects, without going so far as to derive
either of the later doctrines from the other<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c008'><sup>[128]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>However this may be, there is a fair consensus of opinion
among the Fathers of the Church as to the doctrines current
among those whom, for reasons to be presently seen, they called
the Ophites or worshippers of the Serpent. The aim of the
sect seems to have been to produce an eclectic system which
should reconcile the religious traditions current from time
immemorial in Western Asia with the worship of the Hellenized
gods of Asia Minor, and the teachings of the already powerful
Christian Church. With this view they went back to what is
probably the earliest philosophical theory of the origin of the
universe, and declared that before anything was, there existed
God, but God conceived as an infinite ocean of divinity, too
great and too remote to be apprehended by man’s intelligence,
of whom and of whose attributes nothing could be known or
said, and who could only be likened to a boundless sea. Something
like this was the view of the earliest inhabitants of Babylonia,
who declared that before heaven or earth or the gods
came into being there was nothing but a vast waste of waters<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c008'><sup>[129]</sup></a>.
At some time or another, the same idea passed into Egypt,
when the Egyptians attributed the beginning of things to Nu
or the primaeval deep<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c008'><sup>[130]</sup></a>; and it was probably the spread of
this tradition into Ionia which induced Thales of Miletus, the
earliest of the Ionian philosophers, to assert that water was
the first of all things<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c008'><sup>[131]</sup></a>. This unknowable and inaccessible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>power, the Ophites declared to be ineffable or impossible to
name, and he was only referred to by them as Bythos or the
Deep. The same idea and the same name were adopted by
most of the later Gnostics<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c008'><sup>[132]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>From this unknowable principle or Father (Πατὴρ ἄγνωστος)
there shone forth, according to the Ophites, a Primordial Light,
infinite and incorruptible, which is the Father of all things
subsequent to him<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c008'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. Here they may have been inspired, not
by the Babylonian, but by its derivative, the Jewish tradition
given in the Book of Genesis<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c008'><sup>[134]</sup></a>. But this Light was in effect,
though not in name, the chief god of their system, and in Asia
Minor the gods had never perhaps been imagined as existing
in any but human form. Accordingly they described this Light
as the First Man, meaning thereby no terrestrial creature, but
a heavenly or archetypal man in whose likeness mankind was
afterwards made<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c008'><sup>[135]</sup></a>. From him came forth a second Light
sometimes called his Ennoia or Thought, which expression
seems to cover the idea that this Second Man or Son of Man,
by both which names he was known to the Ophites, was not
begotten in the ordinary way of mortals, but was produced
from the First Man as a thought or concept is formed in the
brain<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c008'><sup>[136]</sup></a>. Or we may, to take another metaphor, regard this
Ennoia as the rays of light which emanate or flow forth from
a lamp or other source of light, but which have no independent
existence and still remain connected with their parent. Such
was the Ophite idea with regard to the two great Lights or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>First and Second Man whom they refused to consider as separate,
giving them both the name of Adamas, or the Unconquered,
a classical epithet of the Hades already identified at Eleusis
with Dionysos<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c008'><sup>[137]</sup></a>. They also called them, as will be seen later,
the Father-and-Son. In this, perhaps, they did not go outside
the conception of the Anatolian religion, which always represented
the Divine Son as the spouse of the goddess who gave him
birth, and in this way eternally begetting himself. Thus, the
Phrygian goddess Cybele under the name of Agdistis was said to
be violently enamoured of Atys who was in effect her own son<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c008'><sup>[138]</sup></a>.
The same idea was familiar to the Egyptians, among whom
more than one god is described as the “bull (<i>i.e.</i> male or husband)
of his mother,” and it may thus have passed into the Alexandrian
religion, where Horus was, as we have seen, often given instead
of Osiris as the lover of Isis<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c008'><sup>[139]</sup></a>. At Eleusis it was more modestly
concealed under the myth which made Dionysos or Hades at
once the ravisher of Persephone and her son by Zeus in serpent
form—a myth which is summed up in the mystic phrase preserved
by Clement of Alexandria that “The bull is the father
of the serpent, and the serpent the father of the bull<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c008'><sup>[140]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the Ophites accounted for the divinity who was in
effect their Supreme God, the still higher Bythos, as we have
seen, being put in the background as too awful for human
consideration<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c008'><sup>[141]</sup></a>. But it was still necessary to make manifest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the feminine aspect of the deity which was always very prominent
in Asia Minor. The Mother of the Gods, known as
Ma in Lydia, Cybele in Phrygia proper, Artemis at Ephesus,
the unnamed Syrian goddess at Hierapolis, and Aphrodite in
Cyprus and elsewhere<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c008'><sup>[142]</sup></a>, was in the early Christian centuries
the most prominent person in the Anatolian pantheon, a fact
which Sir William Ramsay would attribute to the matriarchate,
<span lang="de"><i>Mutterrecht</i></span>, or custom of descent in the female line, which he
thinks indigenous to Asia Minor. In the earliest Phrygian
religion there seems little doubt that the supreme goddess was
originally considered to be bisexual, and capable of production
without male assistance, as is expressly stated in the legend of
Agdistis or Cybele preserved by Pausanias<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c008'><sup>[143]</sup></a>, and perhaps hinted
at in the stories of Amazons spread throughout the whole of
Asia Minor. But it is probable that, as Sir William Ramsay
himself says, this idea had become less prominent with the
immigration from Europe of tribes of male warriors without
female companions,<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c008'><sup>[144]</sup></a> while Semitic influence was always against
it. Hence the Ophites found themselves compelled to make
their female deity inferior or posterior to their male. “Below
these, again (<i>i.e.</i> below the First and Second Man or Father-and-Son),”
says Irenaeus in reporting their doctrines, “is the Holy
Spirit ... whom they call the First Woman<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c008'><sup>[145]</sup></a>.” Neither he nor
Hippolytus gives us any direct evidence of the source whence
this feminine Power was thought by them to have issued. But
Hippolytus says without circumlocution that “this Man,”
<i>i.e.</i> Adamas or the Father-and-Son, “is both male and female<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c008'><sup>[146]</sup></a>,”
and he quotes the words of an Ophite hymn<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c008'><sup>[147]</sup></a> addressed to him
that: “<i>From</i> thee is Father and <i>through</i> thee is Mother, two
names immortal, parents of Aeons, O thou citizen of heaven,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Man of mighty name<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c008'><sup>[148]</sup></a>!” Later, he puts in the mouth of the
Naassene or Ophite writer from whom he repeatedly quotes,
the phrase:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Spirit is where the Father and the Son are named, from whom
and from the Father it is there born; and this (that is, the Spirit)
is the many-named, myriad-eyed Incomprehensible One for whom
every nature in different ways yearns,”</p>

<p class='c010'>or in other words the soul or animating principle of Nature<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c008'><sup>[149]</sup></a>.
It therefore seems that the first Ophites made their Supreme
God a triad like the Eleusinian, the Alexandrian, and the
Anatolian, consisting of three persons two of whom were males
and the third a female, or a Father, Mother, and Son, of whom
the Son was but another and renewed form of the Father,
while the union of all three was necessary to express every
aspect of the Deity, who was nevertheless one in essence<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c008'><sup>[150]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>This threefold division of things, said the Ophites, ran through
all nature “there being three worlds or universes: the angelic
(that sent directly from God), the psychic, and the earthly or
material; and three Churches: the Chosen, the Called, and the
Captive<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c008'><sup>[151]</sup></a>.” The meaning of these names we shall see later
when we consider the Ophite idea of the Apocatastasis<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c008'><sup>[152]</sup></a> or
return of the worlds to the Deity.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, however, another Power had to be produced which
should serve as an intermediary or ambassador from the Supreme
Triad to the worlds below it. This necessity may have arisen
from Plato’s view, adopted by Philo of Alexandria, that God
was too high and pure to be contaminated by any contact
with matter<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c008'><sup>[153]</sup></a>. But it may also owe something to the idea
common to all Orientals that a king or great man can only
communicate with his inferiors through a <i>wakil</i> or agent; and
that this idea was then current in Phrygia seems plain from
the story in the Acts of the Apostles that in the Lycaonian
province Barnabas, who was of majestic presence, was adored
and nearly sacrificed to as Zeus, while Paul, who was the
principal speaker, was only revered as Hermes<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c008'><sup>[154]</sup></a>. The later
Ophite account of the production of this intermediary power
or messenger which we find in Irenaeus is that the Father-and-Son
“delighting in the beauty of the Spirit”—that is of
the First Woman—“shed their light upon her” and thus
brought into existence “an incorruptible light, the third
man, whom they call Christos<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c008'><sup>[155]</sup></a>.” With this last addition the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Divine Family was considered complete, and the same author
tells us that Christos and his mother were “immediately drawn
up into the incorruptible aeon which they call the veritable
Church<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c008'><sup>[156]</sup></a>.” This seems to be the first appearance in Gnosticism
of the use of the word Church as signifying what was later
called the Pleroma or Fulness of the Godhead; but it may be
compared to the “Great Council” apparently used in the same
sense by some unidentified prophet quoted by Origen, of which
Great Council Christ was said by the prophet to be the “Angel”
or messenger<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c008'><sup>[157]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this perfect Godhead, the Ophites had to show the
evolution of a less perfect universe, a problem which they
approached in a way differing but slightly from that of Simon
Magus. This last, as we have seen, interposed between God
and our own world three pairs of “Roots” or Powers together
with an intermediate world of aeons whose angels and authorities
had brought our universe into existence. These angels
purposely fashioned it from existing matter, the substance most
removed from and hostile to God, in order that they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>rule over it and thus possess a dominion of their own. But the
Ophites went behind this conception, and made the first confusion
of the Divine light with matter the result of an accident.
The light, in Irenaeus’ account of their doctrines, shed by the
Father-and-Son upon the Holy Spirit was so abundant that she
could not contain it all within herself, and some of it therefore,
as it were, boiled over and fell down<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c008'><sup>[158]</sup></a>, when it was received by
that matter which they, like Simon, looked upon as existing
independently<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c008'><sup>[159]</sup></a>. They described this last as separated into four
elements, water, darkness, the abyss, and chaos, which we may
suppose to be different strata of the same substance, the uppermost
layer being apparently the waste of waters mentioned in
Genesis. Falling upon these waters, the superfluity of light of
the Holy Spirit stirred them, although before immovable, to
their lowest depths, and took from them a body formed apparently
from the envelope of waters surrounding it. Then, rising
again by a supreme effort from this contact, it made out of
this envelope the visible heaven which has ever since been
stretched over the earth like a canopy<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c008'><sup>[160]</sup></a>. This superfluity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>light which thus mingled with matter, the earlier Ophites
called, like the authors of the Wisdom-literature, Sophia, and
also Prunicos (meaning apparently the “substitute”) and described
as bisexual<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c008'><sup>[161]</sup></a>. Another and perhaps a later modification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of their doctrine fabled that it sprang from the left side of the
First Woman while Christos emerged from her right. They
therefore called it Sinistra and declared it to be feminine only<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c008'><sup>[162]</sup></a>.
Both traditions agreed that this Sophia or Prunicos put forth
a son without male assistance, that this son in like manner
gave birth to another power and so on, until at last seven powers
at seven removes sprang from Sophia. Each of them fashioned
from matter a habitation, and these are represented as heavens
or hemispheres stretched out one under the other, every one
becoming less perfect as it gets further from the Primordial
Light<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c008'><sup>[163]</sup></a>. Irenaeus and Hippolytus are agreed that the first or
immediate son of Sophia was called Ialdabaoth, a name which
Origen says, in speaking of the Ophites, is taken from the art
of magic, and which surely enough appears in nearly all the
earlier Magic Papyri<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c008'><sup>[164]</sup></a>. Hippolytus says that this Ialdabaoth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>was the Demiurge and father of the visible universe or phenomenal
world<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c008'><sup>[165]</sup></a>. Irenaeus also gives the names of the later
“heavens, virtues, powers, angels, and builders” as being
respectively Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloaeus, Oreus, and Astaphaeus
or Astanpheus, which agrees with the Ophite document
or Diagram to be presently mentioned<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c008'><sup>[166]</sup></a>. The first four of these
names are too evidently the names given in the Old Testament
to Yahweh for us to doubt the assertion of the Fathers that
by Ialdabaoth the Ophites meant the God of the Jews<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c008'><sup>[167]</sup></a>. The
last two names, Oreus and Astaphaeus, Origen also asserts to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>be taken from the art of magic, and may be supposed to have
some connection with fire and water respectively<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c008'><sup>[168]</sup></a>. It is probable
that the later Ophites identified all these seven heavens
with the seven astrological “planets,” <i>i.e.</i> Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon in probably that
order<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c008'><sup>[169]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>How now did the earth on which we live come into being?
The primitive Babylonians, whose ideas and culture were at
a very early date spread over the whole of Asia Minor, conceived
the earth not as a globe but as a circular boat like the ancient
coracle, over which the heavens stretched like a canopy or
hemisphere<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c008'><sup>[170]</sup></a>. Hence we must regard these heavens of the
planetary powers, Ialdabaoth and his progeny, as a series of
covers fitting one within the other like, in the words of the
Fathers, “juggling cups,” or to take another simile, the successive
skins of an onion. The earth stretched below these, but
was at the stage of creation at which we have arrived really
without form and void, being the formless waste of waters which
covered the denser darkness and chaos. The ordered shape
which it afterwards assumed and which we now see, was, in
the Ophite story, the result of the fall of no deity, angel, or
heavenly power, but of Man. Irenaeus’ account of this Second
Fall is that the six powers descended from Ialdabaoth began
to quarrel with their progenitor for supremacy—an idea which
perhaps is to be referred either to the Jewish tradition of the
revolt of the angels or with more likelihood to the astrological
ideas about the benefic and malefic planets<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c008'><sup>[171]</sup></a>. This so enraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>him that he glared in his wrath upon the underlying dregs of
matter, and his thought (ἔννοια) implanted there took birth and
shape<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c008'><sup>[172]</sup></a>. This fresh son of his was possessed of a quality of the
possession of which he himself had never given any evidence,
and was called Nous or Intelligence like the male of Simon’s
first syzygy or pair of roots. But he was said to be of serpent
form (ὀφιόμορφος) because, as says the Naassene or Ophite author
quoted by Hippolytus, “the serpent is the personification of
the watery element,” and therefore, perhaps, the symbol of
that external ocean which the ancients thought surrounded
the inhabited world<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c008'><sup>[173]</sup></a>. It seems more probable, however, that
the Ophites were compelled to introduce this form because the
serpent was worshipped everywhere in Asia Minor as the type
of the paternal aspect of the earth-goddess’ consort<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c008'><sup>[174]</sup></a>. This is
best shown, perhaps, in the Eleusinian legend of Zeus and
Persephone; but Alexander himself was said to have been
begotten by Zeus in the form of a serpent, and no Phrygian
goddess seems ever to have been portrayed without one<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c008'><sup>[175]</sup></a>. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>much was this the case that in the Apocryphal <i>Acta Philippi</i>
it is said that sacred serpents were kept in all the heathen
temples in Asia. Hierapolis is, in the same document, called
Ophioryma or the serpent’s stronghold, whence idolatry seems
to be spoken of as the Echidna or Viper<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c008'><sup>[176]</sup></a>. The connection of
the serpent with the Sabazian rites has already been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Ophiomorphus, or god in serpent form, was in the
later Ophite teaching the cause not only of man’s soul but of
his passions. The Latin text of Irenaeus says that from him
came “the spirit and the soul and all earthly things, whence
all forgetfulness, and malice, and jealousy, and envy, and
death came into being<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c008'><sup>[177]</sup></a>.” This was evidently written under
the influence of the Christian idea that the serpent of Genesis
was Satan or the Devil. But Hippolytus tells us, no doubt
truly, that the Ophiomorphus of the earlier Ophites was in
the opinion of his votaries a benevolent and beneficent power.
After saying that they worship</p>

<p class='c009'>“nothing else than Naas, whence they are called Naassenes, and
that they say that to this Naas (or serpent) alone is dedicated every
temple, and that he is to be found in every mystery and initiatory
rite,” he continues, “They say that nothing of the things that are,
whether deathless or mortal, with or without soul, could exist apart
from him. And all things are set under him, and he is good and
contains all things within himself, as in the horn of the unicorn,
whence beauty and bloom are freely given to all things that exist
according to their nature and relationship<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c008'><sup>[178]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It can hardly be doubted that the writer from whom Hippolytus
here quotes is referring to the soul or animating principle of
the world, whom he here and elsewhere identifies with the great
God of the Greek mysteries<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c008'><sup>[179]</sup></a>. Hence it was the casting-down
to this earth of Ophiomorphus which gave it life and shape,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and thus stamped upon it the impress of the First Man<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c008'><sup>[180]</sup></a>. As
Ophiomorphus was also the child of Ialdabaoth son of Sophia,
the Soul of the World might therefore properly be said to be
drawn from all the three visible worlds<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c008'><sup>[181]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We come to the creation of man which the Ophites attributed
to the act of Ialdabaoth and the other planetary powers, and
represented as taking place not on the earth, but in some one
or other of the heavens under their sway<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c008'><sup>[182]</sup></a>. According to
Irenaeus—here our only authority—Ialdabaoth boasted that
he was God and Father, and that there was none above him<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c008'><sup>[183]</sup></a>.
His mother Sophia or Prunicos, disgusted at this, cried out
that he lied, inasmuch as there was above him “the Father of
all, the First Man and the Son of Man<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c008'><sup>[184]</sup></a>”; and that Ialdabaoth
was thereby led on the counsel of the serpent or Ophiomorphus
to say, “Let us make man in our own image<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c008'><sup>[185]</sup></a>!” Here the
Greek or older text of Irenaeus ends, and our only remaining
guide is the later Latin one, which bears many signs of having
been added to from time to time by some person more zealous
for orthodoxy than accuracy. Such as it is, however, it narrates
at a length which compares very unfavourably with the brevity
and concision of the statements of the Greek text, that Ialdabaoth’s
six planetary powers on his command and at the
instigation of Sophia formed an immense man who could only
writhe along the ground until they carried him to Ialdabaoth
who breathed into him the breath of life, thereby parting with
some of the light that was in himself; that man “having
thereby become possessed of intelligence (Nous) and desire
(Enthymesis) abandoned his makers and gave thanks to the
First Man”; that Ialdabaoth on this in order to deprive man
of the light he had given him created Eve out of his own
desire; that the other planetary powers fell in love with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>beauty and begot from her sons who are called angels; and
finally, that the serpent induced Adam and Eve to transgress
Ialdabaoth’s command not to eat of the fruit of the Tree of
Knowledge<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c008'><sup>[186]</sup></a>. On their doing so, he cast them out of Paradise,
and threw them down to this world together with the serpent
or Ophiomorphus. All this was done by the secret contrivance
of Sophia, whose object throughout was to win back the light
and return it to the highest world whence it had originally
come. Her manner of doing so seems to have been somewhat
roundabout, for it involved the further mingling of light
with matter, and even included the taking away by her of
light from Adam and Eve when turned out of Paradise and
the restoring it to them when they appeared on this earth—a
proceeding which gave them to understand that they had
become clothed with material bodies in which their stay would
be only temporary<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c008'><sup>[187]</sup></a>. Cain’s murder of Abel was brought about
by the same agency, as was the begettal of Seth, ancestor of
the existing human race. We further learn that the serpent
who was cast down got under him the angels begotten upon
Eve by the planetary powers, and brought into existence six
sons who, with himself, form “the seven earthly demons.”
These are the adversaries of mankind, because it was on account
of man that their father was cast down; and “this serpent
is called Michael and Sammael<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c008'><sup>[188]</sup></a>.” Later Ialdabaoth sent the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Flood, sought out Abraham, and gave the Law to the Jews.
In this, as in everything, he was opposed by his mother Sophia,
who saved Noah, made the Prophets prophesy of Christ, and
even arranged that John the Baptist and Jesus should be born,
the one from Elizabeth and the other from the Virgin Mary<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c008'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.
In all this, it is difficult not to see a later interpolation introduced
for the purpose of incorporating with the teaching of the earlier
Ophites the Biblical narrative, of which they were perhaps only
fully informed through Apostolic teaching<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c008'><sup>[190]</sup></a>. It is quite possible
that this interpolation may be taken from the doctrine of the
Sethians, which Irenaeus expressly couples in this chapter with
that of the Ophites, and which, as given by Hippolytus, contains
many Jewish but no Christian features<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c008'><sup>[191]</sup></a>. Many of the stories
in this interpolation seem to have found their way into the
Talmud and the later Cabala, as well as into some of the Manichaean
books.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far, then, the Ophites succeeded in accounting to their
satisfaction for the origin of all things, the nature of the Deity,
the origin of the universe, and for that of man’s body. But
they still had to account in detail for the existence of the soul
or incorporeal part of man. Irenaeus, as we have seen, attributes
it to Ophiomorphus, but although this may have been the belief
of the Ophites of his time, the Naassenes assigned it a more
complicated origin. They divided it, as Hippolytus tells us,
into three parts which were nevertheless one, no doubt corresponding
to the threefold division that we have before seen
running through all nature into angelic, psychic, and earthly<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c008'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The angelic part is brought by Christos, who is, as we have
seen, the angel or messenger of the triune Deity, into “the
form of clay<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c008'><sup>[193]</sup></a>,” the psychic we may suppose to be fashioned
with the body by the planetary powers, and the earthly is
possibly thought to be the work of the earthly demons hostile
to man<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c008'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. Of these last two parts, however, we hear nothing
directly, and their existence can only be gathered from the
difference here strongly insisted upon between things “celestial
earthly and infernal.” But the conveyance of the angelic soul
to the body Hippolytus’ Ophite writer illustrates by a bold
figure from what Homer in the <i>Odyssey</i> says concerning
Hermes in his character of psychopomp or leader of souls<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c008'><sup>[195]</sup></a>.
As to the soul or animating principle of the world, Hippolytus
tells us that the Ophites did not seek information concerning
it and its nature from the Scriptures, where indeed they would
have some difficulty in finding any, but from the mystic rites
alike of the Greeks and the Barbarians<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c008'><sup>[196]</sup></a>; and he takes us in
turns through the mysteries of the Syrian worshippers of Adonis,
of the Phrygians, the Egyptian (or rather Alexandrian) worshippers
of Osiris, of the Cabiri of Samothrace, and finally
those celebrated at Eleusis, pointing out many things which
he considers as indicating the Ophites’ own peculiar doctrine
on this point<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c008'><sup>[197]</sup></a>. That he considers the god worshipped in all
these different mysteries to be one and the same divinity seems
plain from a hymn which he quotes as a song of “the great
Mysteries,” and which the late Prof. Conington turned into
English verse<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c008'><sup>[198]</sup></a>. So far as any sense can be read into an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>explanation made doubly hard for us by our ignorance of what
really took place in the rites the Ophite writer describes, or
of any clear account of his own tenets, he seems to say that
the many apparently obscene and sensual scenes that he alludes
to, cover the doctrine that man’s soul is part of the universal
soul diffused through Nature and eventually to be freed from
all material contact and united to the Deity; whence it is
only those who abstain from the practice of carnal generation
who can hope to be admitted to the highest heaven<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c008'><sup>[199]</sup></a>. All this
is illustrated by many quotations not only from the heathen
poets and philosophers, but also from the Pentateuch, the
Psalms, the Jewish Prophets, and from the Canonical Gospels
and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul’s Epistles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The connection of such a system with orthodox Christianity
seems at first sight remote enough, but it must be remembered
that Hippolytus was not endeavouring to explain or record
the Ophite beliefs as a historian would have done, but to hold
them up to ridicule and, as he describes it, to “refute” them.
Yet there can be no doubt that the Ophites were Christians or
followers of Christ who accepted without question the Divine
Mission of Jesus, and held that only through Him could they
attain salvation. The difference between them and the orthodox
in respect to this was that salvation was not, according to
them, offered freely to all, but was on the contrary a magical
result following automatically upon complete initiation and
participation in the Mysteries<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c008'><sup>[200]</sup></a>. Texts like “Strait is the way
and narrow is the gate that leadeth into eternal life” and “Not
every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven” were laid hold of by them as showing
that complete salvation was confined to a few highly instructed
persons, who had had the sense to acquire the knowledge of
the nature of the Deity and of the topography of the heavenly
places which underlay the ceremonies of the Mysteries. Such
an one, they said after his death would be born again not with
a fleshly but with a spiritual body and passing through the
gate of heaven would become a god<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c008'><sup>[201]</sup></a>. It does not follow,
however, that those who did not obtain this perfect <i>gnosis</i>
would be left, as in some later creeds, to reprobation. The
cry of “all things in heaven, on earth, and below the earth<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c008'><sup>[202]</sup></a>”
that the discord of this world<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c008'><sup>[203]</sup></a> might be made to cease, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the Naassene author quoted by Hippolytus daringly connects
with the name of Pappas given by the Phrygians to Sabazius
or Dionysos, would one day be heard, and the Apocatastasis
or return of the world to the Deity would then take place<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c008'><sup>[204]</sup></a>.
If we may judge from the later developments of the Ophite
teaching this was to be when the last spiritual man (πνευματικός)
or perfect Gnostic had been withdrawn from it. In the meantime
those less gifted would after death pass through the
planetary worlds of Ialdabaoth until they arrived at his heaven
or sphere, and would then be sent down to the earth to be
reincarnated in other bodies. Whether those who had attained
some knowledge of the Divine nature without arriving at
perfect Gnosis would or would not be rewarded with some
sort of modified beatitude or opportunity of better instruction
is not distinctly stated, but it is probable that the Ophites
thought that they would<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c008'><sup>[205]</sup></a>. For just as those who have been
admitted into the Lesser Mysteries at Eleusis ought to pause
and then be admitted into the “great and heavenly ones,”
the progress of the Ophite towards the Deity must be progressive.
They who participate in these heavenly mysteries,
says the Naassene author, receive greater destinies than the
others<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c008'><sup>[206]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might seem, therefore, that the Mysteries or secret rites
of the heathens contained in themselves all that was necessary
for redemption, and this was probably the Ophite view so
far as the return of the universe to the bosom of the Deity
and the consequent wiping out of the consequences of the
unfortunate fall of Sophia or Prunicos were concerned. A
tradition. preserved by Irenaeus says that Sophia herself “when
she had received a desire for the light above her, laid down
the body she had received from matter—which was, as we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>seen, the visible heaven—-and was freed from it<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c008'><sup>[207]</sup></a>.” But this
seems to be an addition which is not found in the Greek version,
and is probably taken from some later developments of the
Ophite creed. It is plain, however, that the whole scheme
of nature as set forth in the opinions summarized above is
represented as contrived for the winning-back of the light—for
which we may, if we like, read life—from matter, and this
is represented as the work of Sophia herself. The futile attempt
of the arrogant and jealous Ialdabaoth to prolong his rule by
the successive creation of world after world, of the archetypal
or rather protoplasmic Adam, and finally of Eve, whereby the
light is dispersed through matter more thoroughly but in ever-diminishing
portions<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c008'><sup>[208]</sup></a>, is turned against him by his mother
Sophia, the beneficent ruler of the planetary worlds, who even
converts acquaintance with the “carnal generation” which
he has invented into a necessary preparation for the higher
mysteries<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c008'><sup>[209]</sup></a>. Thus Hippolytus tells us that the Naassenes</p>

<p class='c009'>“frequent the so-called mysteries of the Great Mother, thinking
that through what is performed there, they see clearly the whole
mystery. For they have no complete advantage from the things
there performed except that they are not castrated. [Yet] they
fully accomplish the work of the castrated [<i>i.e.</i> the Galli]. For
they most strictly and carefully preach that one should abstain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>from all companying with woman, as do the castrated. And the
rest of the work, as we have said at length, they perform like the
castrated<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c008'><sup>[210]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So far, then, as the general scheme of the redemption of
light from matter is concerned, there seems to have been no
fundamental necessity in the Ophite view for the Mission of
Jesus. But they assigned to Him a great and predominant
part in hastening the execution of the scheme, and thus bringing
about the near approach of the kingdom of heaven. We
have seen that Sophia provided in spite of Ialdabaoth for the
birth of the man Jesus from the Virgin Mary, and the Naassene
author said that</p>

<p class='c009'>“into this body of Jesus there withdrew and descended things
intellectual, and psychic, and earthly: and these three Men (<i>i.e.</i>
the First Man, the Son of Man, and Christos) speak together through
Him each from his proper substance unto those who belong to
each<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c008'><sup>[211]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Latin text of Irenaeus amplifies the statement considerably
and says that Prunicus, as it calls Sophia, finding no rest in
heaven or earth, invoked the aid of her mother the First Woman.
This power, having pity on her repentance, implored the First
Man to send Christos to her assistance. This prayer was
granted, and Christos descended from the Pleroma to his sister
Sophia, announced his coming through John the Baptist,
prepared the baptism of repentance, and beforehand fashioned
Jesus, so that when Christos came down he might find a pure
vessel, and that by Ialdabaoth her own son, the “woman”
might be announced by Christ. The author quoted by Irenaeus
goes on to say that Christ descended through each of the seven
heavens or planetary worlds in the likeness of its inhabitants,
and thus took away much of their power. For the sprinkling
of light scattered among them rushed to him, and when he
came down into this world he clothed his sister Sophia with
it, and they exulted over each other, which they (the Ophites)
“describe as the [meeting of] the bridegroom and the bride.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>But “Jesus being begotten from the Virgin by the operation
of God was wiser, purer, and juster than all men. Christos
united to Sophia descended into Him [in His baptism] and so
Jesus Christ was made<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c008'><sup>[212]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jesus then began to heal the sick, to announce the unknown
Father, and to reveal Himself as the Son of the first man.
This angered the princes of the planetary worlds and their
progenitor, Ialdabaoth, who contrived that He should be killed.
As He was being led away for this purpose, Christos with
Sophia left Him for the incorruptible aeon<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c008'><sup>[213]</sup></a> or highest heaven.
Jesus was crucified; but Christos did not forget Him and sent
a certain power to Him, who raised Him in both a spiritual
and psychic body, sending the worldly parts back into the world.
After His Resurrection, Jesus remained upon earth eighteen
months, and perception descending into Him taught what
was clear. These things He imparted to a few of his disciples
whom He knew to be capable of receiving such great mysteries,
and He was then received into heaven. Christos sate down
at the night hand of Ialdabaoth that he might, unknown to
this last, take to himself the souls of those who have known
these mysteries, after they have put off their worldly flesh.
Thus Ialdabaoth cannot in future hold holy souls that he may
send them down again into the age [<i>i.e.</i> this aeon]; but only
those which are from his own substance, that is, which he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>himself breathed into bodies. When all the sprinkling of light
is thus collected, it will be taken up into the incorruptible
aeon. The return to Deity will then be complete, and matter
will probably be destroyed. In any case, it will have lost the
light which alone gives it life<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c008'><sup>[214]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>What rites or form of worship were practised by these
Ophites we do not know, although Epiphanius preserves a
story that they were in the habit of keeping a tame serpent
in a chest which at the moment of the consecration of their
Eucharist was released and twined itself round the consecrated
bread<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c008'><sup>[215]</sup></a>. Probably the very credulous Bishop of
Constantia was misled by some picture or amulet depicting
a serpent with his tail in its mouth surrounding an orb or
globe which represents the mundane egg of the Orphics. In
this case the serpent most likely represented the external
ocean which the ancients thought surrounded the habitable
world like a girdle. But the story, though probably untrue,
is some evidence that the later Ophites used, like all post-Christian
Gnostics, to practise a ceremony resembling the
Eucharist, and certainly administered also the rite of baptism
which is alluded to above in the tale of the descent of Christos.
Hippolytus also tells us that they used to sing many hymns
to the First Man; and he gives us a “psalm” composed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>them which, as he thinks, “comprehends all the mysteries
of their error<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c008'><sup>[216]</sup></a>.” Unfortunately in the one text of the <i>Philosophumena</i>
which we have, it is given in so corrupt a form
that the first German editor declared it to be incapable of
restoration. It may perhaps be translated thus:</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It is probable that this psalm really did once contain a
summary of the essential parts of the Ophite teaching. In
whatever way we may construe the first three lines, which
were probably misunderstood by the scribe of the text before us,
there can hardly be a doubt that they disclose a triad of three
powers engaged in the work of salvation<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c008'><sup>[217]</sup></a>. The fall of Sophia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>seems also to be alluded to in unmistakable terms, while the
Mission of Jesus concludes the poem. Jesus, not here distinguished
from the Christos or Heavenly Messenger of the
Trinity, is described as sent to the earth for the purpose of
bringing hither certain “mysteries” which will put man on
the sacred path of Gnosis and thus bring about the redemption
of his heavenly part from the bonds of matter. These “mysteries”
were, as appears in Hippolytus and elsewhere, sacraments
comprising baptism, unction, and a ceremony at least
outwardly resembling the Christian Eucharist or Lord’s Supper<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c008'><sup>[218]</sup></a>.
These had the magical effect, already attributed by the Orphics
to their own homophagous feast, of changing the recipient’s
place in the scale of being and transforming him <i>ipso facto</i>
into something higher than man. That the celebration of
these mysteries was attended with the deepest secrecy accounts
at once for their being nowhere described in detail by Hippolytus’
Ophite author, and also for the stories which were current
among all the heresiological writers of filthy and obscene rites<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c008'><sup>[219]</sup></a>.
Fortified by these mysteries, and by the abstinences and the
continence which they entailed—at all events theoretically,
and as a counsel of perfection—the Ophite could attend, as
we have seen, all the ceremonies of the still pagan Anatolians
or of the Christian Church indifferently, conscious that he alone
understood the inner meaning of either.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another practice of the Ophites has accidentally come
down to us which deserves some mention. The division of
the universe into three parts, <i>i.e.</i> angelic, psychic, and earthly,
which we have already seen in germ in the system of Simon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Magus, was by the Ophites carried so much further than by him
that it extended through the whole of nature, and seriously
affected their scheme of redemption. Father Giraud, as we have
seen, goes so far as to say that in the opinion of Naassenes,
matter hardly existed, and that they thought that not only did
Adamas, or the first man, enter into all things, but that in their
opinion all things were contained within him<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c008'><sup>[220]</sup></a>. This pantheistic
doctrine may have been current in Phrygia and traces of it
may perhaps be found in the Anatolian worship of nature;
but the words of the Naassene psalm quoted above show that
the Naassenes, like all the post-Christian Gnostics of whom we
know anything, thought that matter not only had an independent
existence, but was essentially malignant and opposed
to God. They divided, as we have seen, the universe which
came forth from Him into three parts of which the angelic,
noëtic, or pneumatic included, apparently, nothing but the
Pleroma or Fulness of the Godhead consisting of the Trinity
of Father, Son and Mother with their messenger Christos.
Then followed the second, psychic, or planetary world, containing
the heaven of Sophia with beneath it the holy hebdomad or
seven worlds of Ialdabaoth and his descendants<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c008'><sup>[221]</sup></a>. Below this
came, indeed, the choïc, earthly, or terrestrial world, containing
some sparks of the light bestowed upon it consciously by Sophia
and unconsciously by Ialdabaoth, and inhabited by mortal
men. But this world was the worst example of the “discord”
(ὰσυμφωνία), or as it was called later, the “confusion”
(κέρασμος), caused by the mingling of light with matter, and
as such was doomed to extinction and to eternal separation from
the Divine.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c008'><sup>[222]</sup></a> In like manner, the soul of man consisted of three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>parts corresponding to the three worlds, that is to say, the
pneumatic, psychic, and earthly; and of these three, the last
was doomed to extinction. Only by laying aside his earthly
part as Jesus had done and becoming entirely pneumatic, could
man attain to the light and become united with the Godhead.
But to do so, his soul must first pass from choïc to psychic and
thence to pneumatic, or, as the Naassene author quoted by
Hippolytus puts it, must be born again and must enter in at
the gate of heaven<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c008'><sup>[223]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This rebirth or passage of the soul from the choïc to the
psychic, and thence to the pneumatic, was, as has been said,
the work of the mysteries, especially of those new ones which
the Ophite Jesus or Christos had brought to earth with Him
from above. The process by which these “changes of the
soul” were brought about was, according to the Naassenes,
“set forth in the Gospel according to the Egyptians<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c008'><sup>[224]</sup></a>.” The
only quotation pertinent to the matter which we have from
this lost work is one preserved for us by Clement of Alexandria
which refers to the coming of a heavenly age “when the two
shall be made one, and the male with the female neither male
nor female<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c008'><sup>[225]</sup></a>”—a saying which seems to refer to the time when
all the light now scattered among the lower worlds shall return
to the androgyne Adamas from whom it once issued. But it
is probable that this gospel only described the upward passage
of the soul in figures and parables probably conveyed in texts
of the Canonical Gospel divorced from their context and their
natural meaning, as in the Naassene author quoted by Hippolytus.
Such a gospel might be a sufficient means of instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>for the living, who could puzzle out its meaning with the help
of their mystagogues or priests<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c008'><sup>[226]</sup></a>; but it must always have
been difficult for the best-instructed to remember the great
complications of worlds, planets, and celestial powers that lay
at the root of it. How difficult then must it have been thought
for the disembodied soul to find its way through the celestial
places, and to confront the “guardians of the gate” of each
with proof of his exalted rank in the scale of being? What
was wanted was some guide or clue that the dead could take
with him like the <i>Book of the Dead</i> of the ancient Egyptians,
some memory or survival of which had evidently come down
to the Alexandrian worship<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c008'><sup>[227]</sup></a>, or like the gold plates which we
have seen fulfilling the same office among the worshippers of
the Orphic gods<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c008'><sup>[228]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the Ophites possessed such documents we have proof
from the remarks of the Epicurean Celsus, who may have
flourished in the reign of Hadrian (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 117-138)<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c008'><sup>[229]</sup></a>. In his
attack on Christianity called <i>The True Discourse</i>, he charges
the Christians generally with possessing a “diagram” in which
the passage of the soul after death through the seven heavens
is portrayed. Origen, in refuting this Epicurean’s arguments
more than a century later, denies that the Church knew anything
of such a diagram, and transfers the responsibility for it to
what he calls “a very insignificant sect called Ophites<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c008'><sup>[230]</sup></a>.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>further says that he has himself seen this diagram and he
gives a detailed description of it sufficient to enable certain
modern writers to hazard a guess as to what it must have looked
like<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c008'><sup>[231]</sup></a>. It seems to have been chiefly composed of circles, those
in the uppermost part—which Celsus says were those “above
the heavens”—being two sets of pairs. Each pair consisted
of two concentric circles, one pair being inscribed, according
to Origen, Father-and-Son, and according to Celsus, “a greater
and a less” which Origen declares means the same thing<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c008'><sup>[232]</sup></a>. By
the side of this was the other pair, the outer circle here being
coloured yellow and the inner blue; while between the two
pairs was a barrier drawn in the form of a double-bladed axe<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c008'><sup>[233]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Above this last” Origen says “was a smaller circle inscribed
‘Love,’ and below it another touching it with the word ‘Life.’ And
on the second circle, which was intertwined with and included two
other circles, another figure like a rhomboid ‘The Forethought of
Sophia.’ And within their (?) point of common section was ‘the
Nature of Sophia.’ And above their point of common section was
a circle, on which was inscribed ‘Knowledge,’ and lower down
another on which was the inscription ‘Comprehension<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c008'><sup>[234]</sup></a>.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also reference made by Origen to “The Gates of
Paradise,” and a flaming sword depicted as the diameter of
a flaming circle and guarding the tree of knowledge and of life;
but nothing is said of their respective places in the diagram.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jacques Matter, whose <span lang="fr"><i>Histoire Critique du Gnosticisme</i></span>
appeared in 1843, without its author having the benefit of
becoming acquainted with Hippolytus’ <i>Philosophumena</i>, which
tells us so much as to the doctrines of the Naassenes or early
Ophites, and Father Giraud, who has on the contrary drawn
largely from it, and whose dissertation on the Ophites was
published in 1884, have both given pictorial representations
of the Ophite diagram. Although they differ somewhat in
the arrangement of the circles, both are agreed that the blue
and yellow circles signify the Holy Spirit and Christos. The
Pleroma or Fulness of the Godhead consisting of Father, Son
and Holy Spirit, with the Christos their messenger, therefore
seems figured in these two pairs of circles. Both Matter and
Father Giraud also arrange four other circles labelled respectively
Knowledge, Nature, Wisdom, and Comprehension (Γνῶσις,
Φύσις, Σοφία, and Σύνεσις) within one large one with a border
of intertwined lines which they call the Forethought of Sophia
(Πρόνοια Σοφίας). This may be the correct rendering, but
it is hardly warranted by Origen’s words given above, nor do
we know of any powers, aeons, or other entities in the Ophite
system called Gnosis or Physis<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c008'><sup>[235]</sup></a>. In any event, however, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>is fairly clear that this part of the diagram represents the
Sophia who fell from the Holy Spirit into matter, and that
her natural or first place should be the heaven stretched out
above the seven planetary worlds. Yet Irenaeus tells us that
the Ophites he describes thought that Sophia succeeded finally
in struggling free from the body of matter and that the super-planetary
firmament represented merely the lifeless shell she
had abandoned<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c008'><sup>[236]</sup></a>. This is, perhaps, the view taken by the
framers of the diagram.</p>

<p class='c007'>However that may be, Origen’s discourse agrees with Celsus
in describing a “thick black line marked Gehenna or Tartarus”
which cuts, as he says, the diagram in two. This is specially
described by Celsus; and if it surprises anyone to find it thus
placed above the planetary heavens, it can only be said that
later Gnostics, including those who are responsible for the
principal documents of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> to be presently mentioned,
put one of the places where souls were tortured in
“the Middle Way” which seems <i>above</i>, and not, like the
classical Tartarus, <i>below</i> the earth<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c008'><sup>[237]</sup></a>. Below this again, come
the seven spheres of the planets dignified by the names of
Horaios, Ailoaios, Astaphaios, Sabaoth, Iao, Ialdabaoth and
Adonai respectively. These names are, indeed, those given
in Irenaeus as the names of the descendants of Sophia, although
the order there given is different. As to the meaning of them,
Origen declares that Ialdabaoth, Horaios, and Astaphaios are
taken from magic and that the others are (the Hebrew) names
of God<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c008'><sup>[238]</sup></a>. But it should be noticed that Origen is in this place
silent as to their situation in the diagram, and that those assigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>to them in Matter’s and Father Giraud’s reconstructions are
taken from the prayers or “defences” which will be given
independently of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The division which Matter calls “Atmosphère terrestre” and
Father Giraud “The Fence of Wickedness” (Φραγμὸς Κακίας)
is also not to be found in Origen’s description of the diagram,
but is taken from another passage where he defines it as the
gates leading to the aeon of the archons<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c008'><sup>[239]</sup></a>. The remaining
sphere, containing within itself ten circles in Matter’s reconstruction
and seven in Father Giraud’s, is however fully described.
The number ten is, as Matter himself admitted to be
probable, a mistake of the copyist for seven<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c008'><sup>[240]</sup></a>, and there can
be no doubt that the larger sphere is supposed to represent
our world. The word “Leviathan” which in accordance with
Origen’s description is written both at the circumference and
at the centre of the circle<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c008'><sup>[241]</sup></a> is evidently Ophiomorphus or the
serpent-formed son of Ialdabaoth whom we have seen cast
down to earth by his father together with the protoplasts
Adam and Eve<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c008'><sup>[242]</sup></a>. He should according to the later Gnostics
be represented in the shape of a “dragon” or serpent coiled
round the world and having his tail in his mouth, while the
seven circles within the ring thus formed are the seven Archons
or ruling spirits created by him in imitation of Ialdabaoth.
These are represented in beast-like form and are, as we have
seen, hostile to man. The first four have the Hebrew angelic
names of Michael, Suriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, perhaps because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the four planetary worlds to which they correspond bear also
Hebrew names of God<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c008'><sup>[243]</sup></a>. The remaining three Thauthabaoth,
Erataoth, and Thartharaoth are probably taken from the peculiar
corruption of Hebrew and Egyptian words to be found in
the Magic Papyri. Some of them, at any rate, we meet again
later. The word Behemoth which appears at the foot of the
diagram may be translated “animals<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c008'><sup>[244]</sup></a>.” It may either be a
further description of the seven Archons—as seems most likely—or
be taken in its etymological sense as the animal kingdom
which in the scale of being succeeds terrestrial man.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this diagram, Origen adds the prayers or defences above
alluded to, which he draws from some source not mentioned.
He calls them the “instruction” which they (<i>i.e.</i> the Ophites)
receive after passing through the “fence of wickedness,—gates
which are subjected to the world of the Archons<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c008'><sup>[245]</sup></a>”; but we
know from other sources that they are the speeches, “defences”
or passwords required to be uttered by the soul of the initiated
when, released from this world by death, she flies upwards
through the planetary spheres<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c008'><sup>[246]</sup></a>. As they contain many instructive
allusions, they can best be given in Origen’s own
words, at the same time remarking that the reading is not in
all cases very well settled. The first power through whose
realm the soul had to pass is not here mentioned by name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>but by the process of exhaustion is plainly the one whom
Irenaeus calls Adonaeus or Adonai.</p>

<p class='c007'>To him the soul of the dead is to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I salute the one-formed king, the bond of blindness, thoughtless
oblivion, the first power preserved by the spirit of Pronoia and by
Sophia; whence I am sent forth pure, being already part of the light
of the Son and of the Father. Let grace be with me, O Father,
yea let it be with me<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c008'><sup>[247]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In passing through the next mentioned, which is the realm of
Ialdabaoth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou O First and Seventh, born to command with boldness,
Ialdabaoth the Ruler (Archon) who hast the word of pure Mind
(νοῦς), a perfect work to the Son and the Father, I bring the symbol

in thy aeon thou didst close, and pass again free through thy realm.
Let grace be with me, O Father, yea let it be with me<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c008'><sup>[248]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived at Iao, he ought to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou, O Second Iao and first lord of death, who dost rule over
the hidden mysteries of the Son and the Father, who dost shine
by night, part of the guiltless one. I bear my own beard as a symbol

by that which was born from thee by the living word. Let grace
be with me, O Father, yea let it be with me<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c008'><sup>[249]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>To Sabaoth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ruler of the Fifth realm, King Sabaoth, advocate of the law of

be with me, O Father, yea let it be with me<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c008'><sup>[250]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>To Astaphaios:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ὁ Astaphaios, Ruler of the third gate, overseer of the first
principle of water, behold me an initiate, admit me who have been

<p class='c010'>To Ailoaios:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Ailoaios, ruler of the second gate, admit me who brings to thee
the symbol of thy mother, a grace hidden from the powers of the

me<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c008'><sup>[252]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>and to Horaios:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Horaios, who didst fearlessly overleap the fence of fire receiving
the rulership of the first gate, admit me when thou beholdest the
symbol of thy power, engraved on the type of the Tree of Life,

Let grace be with me, O Father, yea let it be with me<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c008'><sup>[253]</sup></a>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>These defences have evidently got out of their proper order,
and have probably been a good deal corrupted as well<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c008'><sup>[254]</sup></a>. But
their form and general purport are mostly intelligible and show
undoubted signs of Egyptian origin. They were therefore
probably not the work of the earlier Ophites or Naassenes,
but were most likely introduced when the Ophite doctrines
began to leave their primitive seat in Phrygia and to spread
westward into North Africa and the south-east of Europe.
The diagram itself seems to be fairly expressive of the more
ancient teaching and in particular the division of all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>below the Godhead into three parts. Thus we find in it the
“middle space” or heaven of Sophia, itself perhaps the Paradise
whence the protoplasts and Ophiomorphus were hurled, then
the world of seven planets, and finally this earth under the
government of Ophiomorphus’ seven angels. To judge from
Origen’s remark that “they say there is a sympathy (συμπάθεια)
between the Star Phaenon (<i>i.e.</i> Saturn) and the lion-like power
(Michael)<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c008'><sup>[255]</sup></a>,” it is probable that the Ophites, like the Babylonian
astrologers, looked upon the system of “correspondences,” as
it was afterwards called, as running through all nature in such
a way that every world and every power inhabiting it was a
reflection of the one above it<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c008'><sup>[256]</sup></a>. That each world according
to the Naassenes contained a “Church” or assembly of souls<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c008'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
is stated in the text quoted above, the “Captive” Church
there mentioned being evidently composed of the souls still
held in the grip of matter, the “Called” of those who had
passed into the planetary worlds, and the “Chosen” of those
who were purified enough to be admitted into the middle space
or Paradise of Sophia<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c008'><sup>[258]</sup></a>. That these last were thought to be
eventually united with the Deity appears in some later developments
of the Ophite faith, but the doctrine seems also to
have been known to the Naassenes, since the author quoted
by Hippolytus speaks of “the perfect gnostics” becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“kingless” (that is, subject to no other being) and as appointed
to “share in the Pleroma<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c008'><sup>[259]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the amount of success which the speculations of the
Ophites enjoyed we know very little. Origen, as we have seen,
speaks of them as being in his day “an insignificant sect”;
and we have no proof that their numbers were ever very large<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c008'><sup>[260]</sup></a>.
Father Giraud asserts on the faith of some of the smaller
heresiologists and Conciliar Acts that they spread over the
whole of Asia Minor, through Syria and Palestine into Egypt
on the one hand, and, on the other, to Mesopotamia, Armenia,
and even to India, and this is probably more or less correct<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c008'><sup>[261]</sup></a>.
But those who had actually read their writings, as Irenaeus
and Hippolytus evidently had done, seem to have looked upon
them more as the source of many later heresies than as formidable
by their own numbers. Whether the Sethians with
whom Irenaeus would identify them were really a subdivision
of the Ophite sect may be doubted, because in Hippolytus’
account of the Sethian doctrines, the existence of Jesus is never
mentioned or referred to, and there is some reason for thinking
them a non-Christian sect<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c008'><sup>[262]</sup></a>. But the heresies of the Peratae
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and of Justinus, which Hippolytus describes as not differing
much from the Ophites, certainly resemble that which has been
summarized above too closely for the resemblance to be accidental;
while the same remark applies to those of the Barbeliotae
and Cainites described by Irenaeus, and to the Gnostics,
Archontics, and others of whom we read in Epiphanius’ <i>Panarion</i>.
Most of these sects seem to have flourished on the Eastern or
Asiatic outskirts of the Roman Empire, although some of them
probably had settlements also in Egypt, Greece, Crete, and
Cyrene. As the first Ophites had contrived to make an amalgam
of the fervent and hysterical worship of nature in Anatolia with
the Jewish and Christian tenets, so no doubt these daughter
sects contrived to fit in with them the legends of the local cults
among which they found themselves. But such compromises
were not likely to last long when the Catholic Church began
to define and enforce the orthodox faith, and the Ophites seem
to have been one of the first to succumb. In the <abbr title='fifth'>Vth</abbr> century
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, there were still Ophite “colleges” to be found in the
province of Bithynia; for Theocritus and Evander, the bishops
of Chalcedon and Nicomedia, “refuted” their leaders publicly
with such effect, says Praedestinatus, that they afterwards
broke into their “secret places” at the head of a furious mob,
drove away their priests, killed the sacred serpents, and “delivered
the people from that danger<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c008'><sup>[263]</sup></a>.” This is the last that
we hear of them as an organized sect, and although Justinian
in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 530 thought right to include them by name in his law
against heretics, it is probable that by then their opinions had
long since passed into other forms<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c008'><sup>[264]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably one of the first changes to take place in the
Ophite faith was the withdrawal into the background of the
serpent worship which respect for the ancient cults of
Asia Minor had imposed upon the earlier members of the sect.
In the diagram, Ophiomorphus does not seem to have been
depicted in his proper shape, although he may perhaps be
identified with the Leviathan there shown as surrounding
the terrestrial world. Those Ophites who wished to obtain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>proselytes among Christian catechumens no doubt felt the
advisability of not insisting upon this conception, inasmuch as
“the serpent” was the figure under which the Oriental Christians
loved to allude to the Pagan worships which still opposed
them in Asia Minor<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c008'><sup>[265]</sup></a>. Hence there arose much confusion among
the Ophites themselves as to the character of the serpent, and
while some, according to Irenaeus, asserted that Sophia the
mother of Ialdabaoth herself became the serpent<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c008'><sup>[266]</sup></a>, Theodoret,
a very late witness, thinks that the Ophites of his time held
that Ophiomorphus, although originally the minister of Sophia,
had gone over to the other side, and had become the enemy
of mankind<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c008'><sup>[267]</sup></a>. In this we may also, perhaps, see, if we will,
the effect of Egyptian influence upon the earlier Ophite teaching;
for in Egypt, the serpent Apep was always looked upon as
the enemy of Râ, the Sun-god, who was rightly considered
the great benefactor of humanity. It is no doubt due to the
same influence that in one of the documents of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i>—one part of which, as will be seen later, was probably
written for the furtherance of a late form of the Ophite heresy—the
serpent, while keeping his place in the Cosmos as the
great ocean which surrounds the earth, is transformed into
the outer darkness of the Canonical Gospels, and described as
a huge torture-chamber for the punishment of souls<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c008'><sup>[268]</sup></a>. The
same document shows us how the Ophites, while adopting all
the ideas of their predecessors the Orphics as to the respective
states of the initiated and uninitiated after death,—including
therein their reincarnation, the draught from the lake of
memory and the like—contrived to mix with them the current
astrological ideas of the time which made all these events
happen in an order determined by the motions of the stars<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c008'><sup>[269]</sup></a>.
This tendency, already visible in Hippolytus’ time in the Ophite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>sect which he calls the Peratae<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c008'><sup>[270]</sup></a>, will, however, be better considered
when we come to deal with the documents of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>There remains to be said that <i>the Gospel according to the
Egyptians</i> mentioned above is the only apocryphal document
that Hippolytus directly attributes to the earlier Ophites or
Naassenes. The sects derived from them seem to have made
use of a great number of others, among which we find a <i>Book
of Baruch</i> otherwise unknown to us, <i>The Paraphrase of Seth</i>,
the <i>Gospels of Nicodemus</i>, <i>Philip</i>, and <i>Thomas</i>, together with
a <i>Gospel according to the Hebrews</i>, which may or may not have
been identical with the one which Hippolytus calls that according
to the Egyptians<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c008'><sup>[271]</sup></a>. Of these, the first two are entirely lost, and
the documents which we possess bearing the name of the
Gospel of Nicodemus relate the events of the Crucifixion in
much the same way as the Canonical Gospels, but add thereto
the visit of Jesus to Hades. A <i>Gospel of Thomas</i>, which is
also extant, contains only the account of miracles performed
by Jesus in His infancy, and therefore goes to controvert the
Ophite theory that Christos and Sophia only descended upon
Him at His baptism, and that up to that period He was as
other men. It is probable, however, that our copies of these
Apocryphal Gospels have been severely edited so as to expunge
everything which savoured of Gnostic teaching and may really
have been partly or wholly the work of Ophites<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c008'><sup>[272]</sup></a>. Of the
<i>Gospel of Philip</i>, Epiphanius has preserved a short passage as
follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lord has revealed to me what the soul ought to say when
she goes to heaven, and how she ought to answer each of the Powers
on high. ‘I have known myself,’ she says, ‘and I have collected
myself from everywhere, and I have not begotten children for the
Archon, but I have rooted out his roots, and I have collected the
scattered members, and I know thee what thou art. For I, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>says, am from above<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c008'><sup>[273]</sup></a>.’ And thus he [<i>i.e.</i> Philip] says, she is set
free. But if, he says, she is found to have begotten a son, she is
retained below, until she can receive again her own children, and
draw them up to herself<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c008'><sup>[274]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar expressions are to be found in two of the documents
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, and the abstinence from sexual intercourse
which they enjoin is direct and first-hand evidence rebutting
the accusation of promiscuous immorality which Epiphanius
brings against the Ophites or their related sects. Epiphanius
attributes to the same sect of “Gnostici” the use of a <i>Gospel
of Perfection</i> which “others”—the context shows that he
means certain Ophites—“are not ashamed to call the Gospel
of Eve.” Of this he also preserves a single passage as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stood upon a high mountain, and I saw a huge man and another
who was mutilated [or perhaps only smaller, κολοβὸν] and I heard
a voice of thunder, and I drew near to hearken and he spoke to
me and said, ‘I am thou and thou art I; and where thou art, there
am I, and I am scattered through all things. And whencesoever
thou dost wish, collect me, and in collecting me, thou dost collect
thyself<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c008'><sup>[275]</sup></a>.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Is the greater and lesser man here the Adamas or Father-and-Son
of the Ophites, in which case the latter part of the
passage doubtless refers to the scattering of the light through
the world of matter and the necessity of its collection and
return to the Godhead. The “I am thou and thou art I”
phrase is repeated in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> by the risen Jesus to
His disciples<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c008'><sup>[276]</sup></a>, and seems to refer to the final union of the
perfected human soul with the Deity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>In addition to these books, the Ophites whom Irenaeus
and Hippolytus describe quoted freely from the Canonical
books of the Old Testament, from one of the apocryphal books
of Ezra and from the Book of Tobit, as also from such books
of the Canonical New Testament as the Gospels, including
that of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John, and most of the Pauline Epistles, including
that to the Hebrews<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c008'><sup>[277]</sup></a>. But it would be going too far to say
that they “accepted” these or attributed to them a Divine
origin, or thought them inspired in the sense in which the
word was used by the Catholic Church. On the contrary,
Epiphanius complains that they thought many of the contents
of the Old Testament Books at any rate were inspired only by
Ialdabaoth and the creators of the world of matter for the
purpose of misleading mankind<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c008'><sup>[278]</sup></a>; and throughout they seem
to have considered all the Canonical Scriptures that they quote
as on an equality with the writings of Homer, Hesiod, the
legendary Orpheus, and other heathen writers such as Herodotus.
Without attempting to deny or question the historical truth
of the facts or legends recorded by all these authors, they
regarded them merely as figures having an allegorical or typical
meaning, which they could interpret in any manner they
pleased, so as to make them accord with their own preconceived
theories. Thus the Naassenes when they found <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Luke quoting
from the Proverbs of Solomon that “the just will fall seven
times and rise again,” declared that this referred to the downward
passage of man’s soul through the planetary heavens<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c008'><sup>[279]</sup></a>;
and Justinus, one of the Ophite teachers, finding a story in
Herodotus about Heracles and the serpent-tailed girl whom he
met in Scythia, said that it was a type of the generation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>universe by the combination of the invisible and unforeseeing
Demiurge and the female principle or Sophia<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c008'><sup>[280]</sup></a>. The same
dialectic had already been made use of by the Orphics, by
Philo of Alexandria, and by Simon Magus; but the Ophites
seem to have been the first to apply it to all literature. The
full effect of this method of interpretation we shall see later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Generally speaking, it may be said that the Ophites seem
to have been the first to bring about any kind of amalgamation
between the popular religions of the Near East and the rising
faith of Christianity. By interpreting the “mysteries” or
secret rites of Asia Minor and elsewhere in their own sense,
they supplied Christianity with a mythology which it would
otherwise have lacked and the absence of which must always
have proved a bar to its propagation among other than Semitic
peoples. At the same time they greatly exalted the figure of
Christ, who in their system became much less the personal
teacher and master of the Jewish-Christian communities<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c008'><sup>[281]</sup></a> than
the angel or messenger of the Supreme Being sent from above
in pursuance of a vast scheme for the redemption of the human
race. In this capacity it went some way towards identifying
the historical Jesus with the great god of the Mysteries and
towards giving the sacraments of the newly-founded Church
the secular authority of the rites practised in them. The
influence of the Ophite system or systems upon the sects which
succeeded them is at present hard to define, but there can be
little doubt that some of the documents, which have come
down to us in the Coptic <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> before mentioned and will
be more fully described in <a href='#chap10'>Chapter <abbr title='ten'>X</abbr></a>, can only be explained
by reference to them.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>It seems fairly plain that the originators of the Ophite
teaching were uneducated men<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c008'><sup>[282]</sup></a>. A few quotations from
Homer and Pindar, probably familiar to anyone who listened
to the Rhapsodists, are indeed to be found in the anonymous
author whom Hippolytus quotes under the name of “the
Naassene.” But the reading of the learned of that day consisted
not of poetry but of philosophy; and there is no trace
in his speculations of direct acquaintance with the works of
any philosopher whatever. This is the more striking because
Heraclitus of Ephesus, Zeno of Cyprus, and Cleanthes of Assos
might have been brought into court in support of his cosmogonical
ideas; and the Stoic philosophy was especially an
Asiatic one, having one of its principal homes in Tarsus, and
therefore not very far from Phrygia proper. Its cosmology as
taught in Rome at the period now under discussion<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c008'><sup>[283]</sup></a>, differed
very little from that of the earlier Ophites, and its theory of
“seminal reasons” (λόγοι σπερματικοὶ) or particles of fiery
matter descending from heaven to earth and there becoming
formative principles, together with its belief in metensomatosis
or transmigration has many resemblances with the Ophite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>scheme of redemption<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c008'><sup>[284]</sup></a>. Yet the Naassene author in an age
when philosophy was most in fashion never appeals to the
authority of the founders of the Stoic school or of those followers
of theirs who must have been his contemporaries and countrymen;
and Hippolytus, whose own acquaintance with Greek
philosophy was superficial and hardly first-hand, in his summary
of the Naassene doctrine draws no parallel between the two.
On the other hand, the Naassene author perpetually refers to
the Old Testament which he seems to have known in the Peshitto
or Syrian version, although, as will have been seen, he by no
means regards it from the Jewish standpoint as a divinely
inspired rule of life, and pushes down Yahweh, its God, into
a very inferior position in the scale of being. As the date of
the Peshitto has not yet been put further back than the second
century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c008'><sup>[285]</sup></a>, this would lead one to suppose that it had only
recently come to the notice of the Naassene writer, who probably
welcomed it as a valuable source from which to draw materials
for spells and exorcisms. This excessive reverence for the
letter as apart from the spirit of a document is characteristic
of the magician of the early Christian centuries, and is further
exemplified in a magic papyrus of the <abbr title='third'><span class='fss'>III</span>rd</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, now
in the British Museum, where “a number of single lines taken
without any regard to sense or on any discernible principle from
the Iliad and Odyssey” are arranged in a certain order for use
as a fortune-telling book, and appear in company with magical
recipes for obtaining dreams, compounding love philtres, and
all the usual paraphernalia of a wizard of the period<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c008'><sup>[286]</sup></a>. Such a
use of writings venerable for their antiquity would never enter
into the head of anyone endowed with any literary sense, but
seems natural enough to persons of limited reading, to whom
they form their sole material for study. In reading into the
lives of the Jewish patriarchs hidden allusions to the theories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the origin of the universe and the destiny of man then current
over the whole Hellenistic world, the Naassenes did not behave
differently from our own Puritans of Cromwell’s time, who discovered
in texts like “Take the prophets of Baal, Let not one
of them escape<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c008'><sup>[287]</sup></a>!” a justification for “knocking on the head
out of hand,” the clergy of the opposing party<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c008'><sup>[288]</sup></a>. We may, if we
please, picture to ourselves the earlier Ophites as a handful of
merchants, artizans, freedmen, and slaves inclined by inherited
custom to magical practices and to ecstatic or hysterical forms
of religion, and, as it were, intoxicated by the new field of
speculation which the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into
their own tongue had opened to them. At the same time, their
anti-Semitic feeling, dating perhaps from the time of the Maccabaean
resistance which had materially contributed to the
downfall of the Syrian Empire, and considerably exacerbated
by the atrocities committed by the Jewish rebels at the close
of the <abbr title='first'><span class='fss'>I</span>st</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, must have forced them into an attitude
in every way opposed to Jewish national pretensions; while
it is easy to understand that such persons must have caught
eagerly at any <i>via media</i> which enabled them to reconcile the
Jewish traditions, long familiar to them through spells and
charms, with the legends of the Greek Mysteries, and at the
same time protected them against the social and moral obloquy
attaching to open adherence to the Jewish rites. Such considerations,
perhaps, explain alike the immediate success of
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul’s preaching in Asia Minor, and the outburst of activity
among the Gnostics which followed close upon it<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c008'><sup>[289]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The Gnostic speculations were, however, destined to pass
out of the hands of unlearned men. Although it was hardly
likely to have been noticed at the time, the day was past for
national or particularist religions having for their object the
well-being of one nation or city; and men’s relations to the
Divine world were coming to be looked upon as a matter
concerning the individual rather than the State. Alexander’s
work in breaking down the barriers between people and people
was beginning to bear fruit in the intellectual as it had already
done in the political world, and the thoughtful were everywhere
asking themselves, as Tertullian tells us, not only whence man
and the world had come, but what was the meaning of the evil
within the world<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c008'><sup>[290]</sup></a>. Along with this, too, had come a general
softening of manners which was extremely favourable to speculation
on such subjects, and to which the vagaries of the Caesars
of the Julian house have made us somewhat blind. A reign
of terror might often exist among the great families in the capital
under a jealous or suspicious Emperor, and the majority of the
proletariat might there as in other large towns be entirely given
up to the brutal or obscene amusements of the arena or the
theatre. But in the provinces these things had little effect on
the working of the system set up under the Empire; and the
civilized world was for the first time, perhaps, in its history,
beginning to feel the full benefits of good government and freedom
from foreign invasion. It is quite true that the population
were then, as at the present day, leaving the country and flocking
into the towns, thereby acquiring new vices in addition to their
old ones; but this also led, as town life must always do, to
increased respect for the rights of their neighbours, and to the
extension of the idea of law and order rather than of the right
of the strongest as the governing principle of the universe.
The Roman law, upon which the jurisprudence of every civilized
country is still based, first took coherent shape in the reign
of Hadrian; and Ulpian’s fundamental maxim that before the
law all men are free and equal was founded on a conception of
the rights of the individual very different from the Oriental notion
that all subjects high and low were the chattels of the king.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>In these circumstances, new ethical ideals had arisen which
affected all classes in the State. As Sir Samuel Dill has said in
his charming sketch of Roman manners under the Julian, Flavian
and Antonine emperors, “It has perhaps been too little recognized
that in the first and second centuries there was a great
propaganda of pagan morality running parallel to the evangelism
of the Church<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c008'><sup>[291]</sup></a>.” But this ethical propaganda was an entirely
lay affair, and the work not of the priests but of the philosophers<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c008'><sup>[292]</sup></a>.
It had, indeed, always been so in the Hellenic world, and while
we find it exciting no surprise that a priest of the most sacred
mysteries should be worse instead of better than other men<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c008'><sup>[293]</sup></a>,
it was the philosophers to whom was committed what was later
called the care of souls. Thus Alexander had recourse, when
prostrated by self-reproach after the killing of Clitus, to the
ministrations of Anaxarchus, who endeavoured to console him
with the sophism that kings are not to be judged like other men<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c008'><sup>[294]</sup></a>.
So, too, we hear of the Stoic philosopher, Musonius Rufus, when
the army of Vespasian was besieging Rome, accompanying
the Senate’s embassy to the troops of Antonius, and preaching
to them at the risk of his life upon the blessings of peace and the
horrors of war<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c008'><sup>[295]</sup></a>. Seneca, also, when about to die, endeavours
to stay his friends’ lamentations by reminding them of the
“rules of conduct” by which alone they may expect consolation,
and bequeaths to them the example of his life<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c008'><sup>[296]</sup></a>; while the
“Stoic saint,” Thrasea, when the sentence of death reaches him,
is occupied in listening to a discourse of Demetrius the Cynic
on the nature of the soul and its separation from the body<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c008'><sup>[297]</sup></a>.
This shows an attitude of mind very different from the merely
magical or, as we should say, superstitious belief in the efficacy
of spells and ceremonies; and the example of Epictetus bears
witness that it was that of slaves as well as of senators.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gnosticism, therefore, was bound to become ethical as well
as gnostical, or, in other words, to insist on the efficacy of
conduct as well as of knowledge, so soon as it came into contact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>with thinkers trained in philosophy. Where it did so, in the
first instance, cannot be told with any degree of certainty;
but all probability points to Alexandria as one of the places
where the post-Christian Gnosticism first made alliance with
philosophic learning. Not only was Alexandra the natural
meeting-place of Greeks and Orientals, but it was at the early
part of the IInd century a great deal more the centre of the
intellectual world than either Athens or Rome. Although
Ptolemy <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr> Physcon is said to have expelled from it the philosophers
and scholars of the Museum, they seem to have returned
shortly afterwards, and in the meantime their dispersion in
the neighbouring cities and islands, where most of them must
have supported themselves by teaching, probably did a good
deal towards diffusing the taste for philosophy over a wider
area than before. In Philo’s time, in particular, the Platonic
philosophy had gained such a hold in the city that he, though a
leader of the Jews, had had to assimilate it as best he might<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c008'><sup>[298]</sup></a>,
and, as we have seen, to bring it more or less into harmony with
the traditional beliefs of his own people. A century later we
see the same thing occurring with the now rising sect of Christians;
and a school of Christian philosophy was founded in
Alexandria under the leadership of Pantaenus, the predecessor
in office of the famous Clement of Alexandria<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c008'><sup>[299]</sup></a>. If we may
judge from the writings of this last, the expressed object of
this school was to instil a knowledge of Greek literature and
philosophy into Christian teachers, to bring about which it
attempted to show that, while both philosophy and Christian
theology alike aimed at the discovery of truth, the valuable
parts of the philosophic doctrines were borrowed or derived
from the writings held sacred by Jews and Christians<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c008'><sup>[300]</sup></a>. Nor were
the Alexandrians in the least likely to refuse a hearing to any
new faith however wild. The leading place which Alexandria
had gained among the markets of the world brought within its
gates the adherents of every religion then known, and Jewish
merchants and Christian artizans there mixed with Buddhist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>monks and fetish-worshippers from Central Asia, while the
terms on which they met compelled a wide tolerance for one
another’s opinions, and predisposed its citizens to a practical
amalgam of several apparently conflicting creeds<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c008'><sup>[301]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was into this atmosphere that Gnosticism entered at
least as early as the reign of Hadrian. Who was answerable
for its first introduction there we have no means of knowing,
nor do we even know with any certainty what form Egyptian
Gnosticism first took<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c008'><sup>[302]</sup></a>. One would imagine that the Hellenizing
tendency of the Samaritans might have brought to Alexandria
the doctrines of Simon Magus, but there is no direct evidence
to that effect. The case is different with Antioch, where one
Saturninus or Satornilus—the name is spelt differently by
Irenaeus and Hippolytus—seems to have put forth, at the period
referred to, a <i>quasi</i>-Christian system having some likeness to
that of the Ophites, its chief distinguishing feature being its
hatred of Judaism and its God, for whose overthrow it declared
Christ to have been sent<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c008'><sup>[303]</sup></a>. Like the Ophites, Saturninus rigidly
opposed the commerce of the sexes, declaring marriage and
generation to be alike the work of Satan, the declared enemy
of the world-creating angels, and of their leader the God of the
Jews<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c008'><sup>[304]</sup></a>. But the followers of this Saturninus seem to have been
few in number, and although all the later heresiologists preserved
the memory of his teaching, it is probable that the sect
itself did not long survive its founder<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c008'><sup>[305]</sup></a>. Basilides, whose
name is associated with that of Saturninus by Irenaeus, Hippolytus,
and Epiphanius, who all make him a fellow disciple
with Saturninus of Menander, the continuator or successor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Simon Magus<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c008'><sup>[306]</sup></a>, certainly flourished under the same reign at
Alexandria, where he taught an extremely complicated doctrine,
declaring that between the unknown Father of All and this
world there was interposed a series of 365 heavens corresponding
in number to the days of the year, the chief of them being called
Abraxas, the letters of which word have that numerical value<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c008'><sup>[307]</sup></a>.
This is the account of Irenaeus, not materially varied by any
of the other early writers on heresy, with the exception of
Hippolytus, who gives us a long account of the doctrine of
Basilides and his son Isidore, which according to their own
account they derived from Matthias, the Apostle who replaced
Judas and who received it secretly from Jesus Himself<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c008'><sup>[308]</sup></a>. From
Hippolytus, we learn that Basilides’ complete or final teaching
declared that there was a time when nothing existed—</p>

<p class='c009'>“neither matter, nor substance, nor the Unsubstantial, nor simple,
nor compound, nor the Intelligible, nor the Unintelligible, nor that
which can be comprehended by the senses, nor that which cannot
be so comprehended, nor man, nor angel, nor god, nor anything
which can be named”—</p>

<p class='c010'>and that this God-Who-Was-Not willed to make a world<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c008'><sup>[309]</sup></a>. This
act of volition, exercised in Hippolytus’ words “without will or
mind or consciousness<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c008'><sup>[310]</sup></a>,” produced the Seed of the World which
contained within itself all the future universe, as the grain of
mustard-seed contains the roots, stem, branches, leaves, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>innumerable other seeds of the future plant<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c008'><sup>[311]</sup></a>. In this Seed was
“a Sonhood, threefold in all things, of the same substance with
the God-Who-Was-Not and generated from non-existing things<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c008'><sup>[312]</sup></a>.”
Of this threefold Sonhood, one part was subtle or finely divided
like aether or air, one coarser, and one which needed purification;
and he goes on to describe how the finer part immediately
upon the projection of the Seed, burst forth and flew upwards
until it reached the Non-Existent-One, towards whom, Hippolytus
says, “every nature strains,” on account of “its beauty
and majesty<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c008'><sup>[313]</sup></a>.” The coarser part of the Sonhood attempted
to imitate the first, but failed to do so until helped by the Holy
Spirit who served it as the wing does the bird; but although
the second Sonhood thereby attained beatitude, the Holy
Spirit could not enter into the Godhead along with him “because
it (or she) was of a different substance from him and had nothing
of his nature<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c008'><sup>[314]</sup></a>.” She was therefore left near it, purified and
sanctified by her contact with the Sonhood as a jar which has
once contained perfume still preserves its savour<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c008'><sup>[315]</sup></a>. As for the
third Sonhood, it remained in the Seed of the World, which
thereafter gave birth to the Great Archon or Ruler, who is the
Demiurge or Architect of the Universe and fashions all cosmic
things. This Archon makes out of the things below him a Son
who by the arrangement of the God-Who-Was-Not is greater
and wiser than himself, whence the Archon causes him to sit
at his right hand<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c008'><sup>[316]</sup></a>. This Son is in effect Christ, who reveals
to the Archon the existence of the worlds above him, and sends
the Gospel (here personified) into the world so that by it the
third Sonhood might be purified and thus raised to union with
the God-Who-Was-Not.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>There is no need to follow further the system of Basilides, nor
to describe the extremely complicated tangle of worlds, principalities,
powers, and rulers, including the 365 heavens and their
Archon or ruler Abraxas, which Basilides interposes between this
earth and the Godhead. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau has endeavoured to show
that, in this, Basilides was borrowing from the ancient Egyptian
religion which he imagines to have been still flourishing in the
Egypt of the second Christian century<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c008'><sup>[317]</sup></a>. It may be so; and,
although <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau’s proofs seem hardly strong enough to
bear the weight of the conclusions he would draw from them,
it may be conceded that in the Ogdoad and the Hebdomad of
which we hear so much in Hippolytus’ account of Basilides’
teaching, we have a distinct echo of the extraordinary arithmetic
of the Pharaonic or old Egyptian theology, wherein we are
constantly meeting with an Ennead or “company” of nine
gods which, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Maspero has shown, sometimes consists of
eight, sometimes of ten, and sometimes of a still more discrepant
number of individuals<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c008'><sup>[318]</sup></a>. But Basilides’ system was never intended
for popular use; for he himself said, according to
Irenaeus, that only one out of a thousand or two out of ten
thousand could understand it, and that his disciples should
keep their adherence to it strictly secret, seeking to know all
things, but themselves remaining unknown<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c008'><sup>[319]</sup></a>. Its interest for
us here lies in the fact that Valentinus who transformed post-Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Gnosticism, as will presently be seen, from an esoteric
or mystical explanation of Pagan beliefs<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c008'><sup>[320]</sup></a> into a form of Christianity
able to compete seriously with the Catholic Church, was
himself a native of Egypt, that he studied the Platonic philosophy
in Alexandria<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c008'><sup>[321]</sup></a>, and that he must have resided there at the same
time as Basilides, who was slightly older than he, and died
before Valentinus’ doctrine was promulgated<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c008'><sup>[322]</sup></a>. It is therefore
hardly possible that Valentinus should not have known of
Basilides’ teaching and have borrowed from it, even without
the internal evidence of borrowing afforded by a comparison
of the two systems<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c008'><sup>[323]</sup></a>. The almost total silence of the Fathers as
to Basilides’ school after that of Valentinus became famous is
to be accounted for, as Matter points out, by supposing that
the hearers of Basilides, probably few in number, came over
to him in a body<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c008'><sup>[324]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Basilides, therefore, forms a very important link between
Simon Magus and the pre-Christian Gnostics—with whom
Basilides was connected, as we have seen, through his master
and Simon Magus’ successor Menander—on the one hand, and
Valentinus on the other. But his teaching also explains to us
why so many of the features of the Ophite doctrines also reappear
in the Valentinian heresy. For the three Sonhoods of
Basilides, although described in a fantastic and almost unintelligible
way by Hippolytus, seem to correspond in idea with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the First and Second Man and the Christos of the Naassene
writer; while the Holy Spirit, who is of inferior essence and
therefore remains below the Supreme Godhead, can hardly be
distinguished from the Sophia or Prunicos who in the Ophite
scheme plays so large a part in the work of the redemption of
the light. The power of the Great Archon or Ruler of this
World is also said in Hippolytus’ account of the Basilidean
teaching, to rise no higher than the firmament, which was
placed between the hypercosmic spaces where soared the
Boundary Spirit, and the ordered universe<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c008'><sup>[325]</sup></a>,—a statement
which strictly corresponds to the limit placed on the power
and authority of the Ophite Ialdabaoth. The Archon of
Basilides who must, I think, be intended for Yahweh the God
of the Jews is, like Ialdabaoth, ignorant that there is anything
above him<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c008'><sup>[326]</sup></a>; and although he differs from his prototype in
being better taught by his Son, this is easily explained by
the higher position occupied by both Jews and Christians in
Alexandria than in Phrygia. It is significant also that the
mystic and probably cryptogrammatic name Caulacau which
the Naassene writer uses for the Saviour of his system is applied
to the corresponding person in the system of Basilides<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c008'><sup>[327]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The popularity and success that attended Valentinus’ own
teaching may be judged from the pains that the Fathers took
to oppose it. The five books <i>Against Heresies</i> so often quoted
above were written by Irenaeus with the avowed intention
of refuting Valentinus’ disciples. Hippolytus, who aimed at a
more encyclopaedic account of the heresies of his time, devotes
more space to the Valentinian sect than to any other. Tertullian
not only repeatedly gibes at them after his manner when treating
of other matters, but composed a special book against them
still extant, from which we learn of the existence of other
treatises against them written by Justin Martyr, Miltiades a
Christian sophist, and one Proculus, all which are now lost<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c008'><sup>[328]</sup></a>.
Those near to Valentinus in date seem hardly to have considered
him an enemy of Christianity. Clement of Alexandria
quotes several passages from the writings of him and his
followers, and although it is always with the view of contradicting
the statements of his fellow-countryman, he yet
does so without any of the heat displayed by other controversialists<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c008'><sup>[329]</sup></a>.
On the other hand, the orthodox who wrote long
after Valentinus was in his grave are most bitter against him.
Epiphanius, who seldom had a good word for any one, calls him,
with some justice, the chief of heretics<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c008'><sup>[330]</sup></a>; Philaster of Brescia
says he was more a follower of Pythagoras than of Christ, and
that he led captive the souls of many<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c008'><sup>[331]</sup></a>; Praedestinatus, that he
and his followers throughout the East severely wounded the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Church of God<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c008'><sup>[332]</sup></a>; while Eusebius in his <i>Life of Constantine</i>
produces an Imperial edict against the Valentinians and other
heretics, issued, according to him, some time before the baptism
of its promulgator, and ordering that they shall no longer be
allowed to assemble together and that their “houses of prayer”
shall be confiscated to the use of the Catholic Church<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c008'><sup>[333]</sup></a>. It was
probably in pursuance of some such law, which also enjoined,
as Eusebius tells us, the search for and destruction of their
writings, that a conventicle of the Valentinians at Callinicum on
the Eastern frontier of the Empire was burned by the Christian
mob headed by their bishop and monks in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 388<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c008'><sup>[334]</sup></a>. The
same scenes were no doubt enacted in other parts of the Empire;
and we may, perhaps, see in the fury of the persecutors the
measure of their fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet there is little in the Valentinian doctrine as described
by the Fathers to account for the popularity that it evidently
attained. Valentinus, like all the Gnostics, believed in one
Supreme Source of all things; but he from the first threw over
the extremely philosophical idea of Basilides, which some
writers would derive from Buddhism<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c008'><sup>[335]</sup></a>, of a non-existent God
as the pinnacle of his system. To fill the gap thus left, he
returned to the older conception of the Ophites, and postulated
a Bythos or Deep as the origin of all. But this “Unknowable
Father” was by no means the mere abstraction without direct
action upon the world or man that he was in the systems of the
Ophites and of Basilides. As to the mode of his action, however,
a schism—or rather, a difference of opinion—early manifested
itself among his followers. Some of them gave to Bythos a
female consort called, as Irenaeus, and, following him, Tertullian,
tell us, Silence (Σιγή) and Grace (Χάρις), from whom all the
subsequent aeons or manifestations of the Godhead descended<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c008'><sup>[336]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Irenaeus partly explains away this by the statement that Bythos
or the Perfect Aeon dwelt for boundless ages in rest and solitude
(ἡσυχίᾳ), but that there existed with him Ennoia or Thought.
Whether this last part of the statement was or was not thrown in
so as to force a parallel between the system of Valentinus and
that of Simon Magus from whom the orthodox insisted all later
heresiarchs derived their teaching, cannot now be said. But
Hippolytus, who, while not disputing this derivation, is just as
anxious to show that Valentinus was also much indebted to
the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy learned by him at
Alexandria, tells us that there were other Valentinians who
insisted that the Father (or Bythos) was without spouse (ἀσύζυγος)
not feminine (ἄθηλυς) and lacking nothing (ἀπροσδεής); and
that Valentinus himself said that Bythos was “unbegotten
(ἀγέννητος) not subject to conditions of space or time, having
no counsellor, nor any substance that could be comprehended
by any figure of speech<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c008'><sup>[337]</sup></a>.” Herein either Hippolytus or Valentinus
seems to have been attracted by the ideas of the Neo-Pythagorean
school of Alexandria, who indulged in many
arithmetical theories about the Monad or Final Unity which
went on producing male and female (<i>i.e.</i> odd and even) numbers
alternately until it arrived at the perfect harmony of ten<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c008'><sup>[338]</sup></a>.
Yet those who study ancient religions by the comparative
method will be more inclined to see in this diversity of opinion
among the Valentinians a hesitation between the old idea
current, as we have seen, in the Eastern Mediterranean, that
a god may be bisexual and therefore capable of producing
descendants without female assistance and the ancient Semitic
view (due perhaps to the fact that Semitic languages know only
two genders) which divided the Godhead like everything else
into male and female<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c008'><sup>[339]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>However this may be, all the Valentinian schools seem to
have agreed upon the emanation which immediately proceeded
from the Deep or the Father of All. From Bythos, either alone
or with the help of Sige<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c008'><sup>[340]</sup></a>, there proceeded Mind or Nous (Νοῦς),
called also Monogenes<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c008'><sup>[341]</sup></a> and the Father, the beginning of all
subsequent things. This Nous is said to be “equal and like”
to him from whom he had emanated, and by himself capable
of comprehending the greatness of Bythos<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c008'><sup>[342]</sup></a>. With Nous there
also came forth a female Power named Aletheia or Truth
(Ἀλήθεια), and this pair gave birth to a second syzygy, viz.
Logos or the Word (Λόγος) and Zoe or Life (Ζωὴ), who in their
turn produced a third pair, namely: Anthropos, Man (Ἄνθρωπος)
and Ecclesia, the Church (Ἐκκλησία)<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c008'><sup>[343]</sup></a>. The later Valentinians,
from whom Irenaeus quotes, added to these six aeons, Bythos
and his spouse Sige, thus making up the originating Ogdoad
or eightfold Godhead again called the root and substance of
all [subsequent] things<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c008'><sup>[344]</sup></a>. Valentinus himself, however, probably
did not give Bythos a spouse and held that he remained
apart from and uplifted above his six principal emanations<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c008'><sup>[345]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>This subdivision of the Divine, resembling as it does the
system of Simon Magus before described, may seem at first
sight incredibly foolish and complicated, especially when it is
considered that these “aeons,” as Valentinus calls them, might
be considered not only as powers but as worlds. So it did to
the Fathers, who are never tired of pouring contempt upon it.
Tertullian makes merry over the Valentinian conception of a
universe with an endless series of heavens piled one over the
other, as he says, like the “Lodgings to let” of a Roman <i>insula</i>
or tenement house, or, had he ever seen one, of a New York
skyscraper<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c008'><sup>[346]</sup></a>. Irenaeus jokes cumbrously, comparing the Valentinian
aeons to vegetables as if, he says, a gourd should bring
forth a cucumber and this in its turn a melon<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c008'><sup>[347]</sup></a>. Hippolytus,
indeed, cannot indulge in such jeers because to do so would have
stamped him in the opinion of all the learned of his time as an
uneducated barbarian, his pet theory of Gnosticism being that
all its doctrine was a plagiarism from the Greek philosophers
and notably from Plato. Yet he never loses an opportunity
of calling Valentinus’ opinions “worthless”; and goes out of
his way to tack on to them the system of the Jewish magician
Marcus, who, if we can believe the statements of the Fathers,
exploited the rising sense of religion of the age for his own
immoral or interested purpose<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c008'><sup>[348]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet a statement that Tertullian lets drop, as if accidentally,
may teach us to beware of taking Valentinus’ supposed opinions
on the nature of these hypostases or Persons of the Godhead
more literally than he did himself. In his treatise against the
Valentinians the “furious African barrister” is led away by
the exigencies of his own rhetoric to tell us that there were some
among them who looked upon all this elaborate description of
the emanations of the Ogdoad as a figure of speech. All the
aeons of the Ogdoad were according to them merely attributes
or names of God. When, they said, God <i>thought</i> of producing
offspring, He thereby acquired the name of <i>Father</i>; and because
his offspring was true, that of <i>Truth</i>; and because He wished
to appear in human form, he was called <i>Man</i>; and because He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>assembled His attributes in His mind and selected from them
those most proper for His purpose, they were called the <i>Church</i>;
and as His only (or unique) Son was, as it were, uttered or sent
forth to mankind, He was called the <i>Word</i>; and from His powers
of salvation, <i>Life</i>; and so on<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c008'><sup>[349]</sup></a>. As we have seen, Valentinus did
not invent <span lang="la"><i>de novo</i></span> his conception of the Godhead, which bears
besides evident marks of having been adopted with slight modification
from that of Simon Magus and the Ophites. This statement
of Tertullian gives us ground therefore for supposing that
he may really have held the same views respecting the Divine
Nature as the Catholic Church, merely giving an allegorical
explanation of the earlier opinions to convince his hearers that
the teaching of the Apostles was not so subversive of or inconsistent
with the way of thinking of the ancient theologians and
philosophers as some of them thought. Clement of Alexandria
shows similar comprehensiveness when he said that in the
Christian faith there are some mysteries more excellent than
others—or, in other words, degrees in knowledge and grace<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c008'><sup>[350]</sup></a>—, that
the Hellenic philosophy fits him who studies it for the
reception of the truth<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c008'><sup>[351]</sup></a>, and that the Christian should rejoice
in the name of Gnostic, so long as he understands that the true
Gnostic is he who imitates God as far as possible<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c008'><sup>[352]</sup></a>. He even
goes further, and himself uses the Gnostic method of personification
of abstract qualities, as when he says that Reverence is the
daughter of Law<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c008'><sup>[353]</sup></a>, and Simplicity, Innocence, Decorum, and Love,
the daughters of Faith<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c008'><sup>[354]</sup></a>. If Valentinus used similar metaphors,
it by no means follows that he was thereby advocating the
worship of many gods, which was the accusation most frequently
brought against him by the Catholic Church. The same accusation
might with equal propriety be made against John Bunyan
on account of his Interpreter and his Mr Greatheart.</p>

<p class='c007'>But whatever Valentinus’ own views with regard to the
Supreme Being may have been, he could no more escape than
did Philo or any other Platonist from the difficulty of explaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the connection of this Perfect God with imperfect matter<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c008'><sup>[355]</sup></a>, and
this had to be the work in his system of an intermediate Power.
This Power was that Nous or Monogenes whom we have seen
was the first and unique being produced from the Unknowable
Father, to whom he seems to have stood in much the same
relation as the Dionysos of the Orphics did to the supreme Zeus<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c008'><sup>[356]</sup></a>.
Yet although it was through this lieutenant of the Unknown
Father that all things were made, he also was too great to act
directly upon matter. Seeing, says Hippolytus in this connection,
that their own offspring, Logos and Zoe, had brought
forth descendants capable of transmission, Nous and his partner
Aletheia returned thanks to the Father of All and offered to
him a perfect number in the shape of ten aeons<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c008'><sup>[357]</sup></a>. These ten
aeons were projected like the direct emanations of the Godhead
in syzygies or pairs, their names being respectively Bythios
or Deep (Βυθιὸς<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c008'><sup>[358]</sup></a>) and Mixis or Mixture (Μίξις), Ageratos or
Who Grows not Old (Ἀγήρατος) and Henosis or Oneness
(Ἕνωσις), Autophyes or Self-Produced (Αὐτοφύης<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c008'><sup>[359]</sup></a>) and
Hedone or Pleasure (Ἡδονή), Akinetos or Who Cannot Be
Moved (Ἀκίνητος) and Syncrasis or Blending (Σύγκρασις),
Monogenes or the Unique (Μονογενὴς)<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c008'><sup>[360]</sup></a> and Macaria or Bliss
(Μακαρία). In like manner, Logos and Zoe wishing to give
thanks to their progenitors Nous and Aletheia, put forth
another set, this time an imperfect number, or twelve aeons,
also arranged in syzygies and called Paraclete (Παράκλητος)
and Faith (Πίστις), Fatherly (Πατρικὸς) and Hope (Ἐλπίς),
Motherly (Μητρικὸς) and Love (Ἀγάπη), Ever-Thinking
(Ἀείνους<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c008'><sup>[361]</sup></a>) and Comprehension (Σύνεσις), Of the Church
(Ἐκκλησιαστικὸς) and Blessedness (Μακαριότης), Longed-for
(Θελητὸς) and Wisdom (Σοφία). It was through this last, as
through her namesake in the system of the Ophites, that the
Divine came to mingle with Matter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Before coming to this, however, it will be well to say something
here about the ideas that seem to lie behind the names
of this series of aeons numbering, with the first six, twenty-eight
in all, which thus made up what was known as the Pleroma or
Fulness of the Godhead. If we arrange them in three families
or groups according to their parentage, thus:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>it will be seen that among the elder members of each group,
that is, the three first syzygies, Nous-Aletheia, Logos-Zoe, and
Anthropos-Ecclesia, the name of the male member of each
syzygy is always that of an actual and concrete concept—the
Mind, the Word, and Man,—showing perhaps how thought and
speech all marked different stages in the evolution of the being
called the Perfect Man<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c008'><sup>[362]</sup></a>; while the appellatives of the females
of each syzygy—Truth, Life, and the Church—all connote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>abstract ideas<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c008'><sup>[363]</sup></a>. With the Decad put forth by Nous and
Aletheia, <i>i.e.</i> Bythios-Mixis, Ageratos-Henosis, Autophyes-Hedone,
Acinetos-Syncrasis, and Monogenes-Macaria, every
male aeon, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau has pointed out, has for name an
adjective, while the females are all described by substantives<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c008'><sup>[364]</sup></a>.
But the names of the male aeons are all epithets or attributes
peculiar to their father Nous, who is thus said to be the abysmal,
never-ageing, creator of his own nature, immovable, and
unique, and those of the female aeons are descriptive of different
states or conditions arising from his action<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c008'><sup>[365]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau
thinks that the names of these last describe a successive degradation
of the Divine Nature; but this does not seem to have been
Valentinus’ intention, and it is hard to see for instance why
Syncrasis or blending should be more unworthy than Mixis or
simple mixture. Moreover, this group of aeons, unlike the six
preceding them, are not reproductive and no direct descendants
follow from their conjugation. Perhaps then we may best
understand Valentinus’ nomenclature as a statement that the
coming together of Mind and Truth produced Profound Admixture,
Never-ageing Union, Self-created Pleasure, Unshakeable
Combination, and Unique Bliss. In like manner, the names
of the members of the Dodecad or group of twelve aeons proceeding
from Logos and Zoe may be read as describing the
Comforting Faith, the Fatherly Hope, the Motherly Love<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c008'><sup>[366]</sup></a>,
the Everlasting Comprehension, the Elect Blessedness, and the
Longed-for Wisdom arising from the conjugation of the Word
and Life or, in one word, from the Incarnation<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c008'><sup>[367]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>To return now to the fall of Sophia which, in the system of
Valentinus, as in that of the Ophites, brought about the creation
of the universe. All the accounts of Valentinus’ teaching that
have reached us seem to agree that Sophia’s lapse was caused,
according to him, not by accident as with the Ophites, but by
her own ignorance and emulation. Leaving the Dodecad, “this
twelfth and youngest of the aeons,” as Hippolytus describes
her<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c008'><sup>[368]</sup></a>, soared on high to the Height of the Father, and perceived
that he, the Unknowable Father, was alone able to bring forth
without a partner<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c008'><sup>[369]</sup></a>. Wishing to imitate him, she gave birth
by herself and apart from her spouse, “being ignorant that only
the Ungenerated Supreme Principle and Root and Height and
Depth of the Universes can bring forth alone.” “For,” says
he (<i>i.e.</i> Valentinus), “in the ungenerated (or unbegotten) all
things exist together. But among generated (or begotten)
things, it is the female who projects the substance, while the
male gives form to the substance which the female has projected<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c008'><sup>[370]</sup></a>.”
Hence the substance which Sophia put forth was
without form and unshapen—an expression which Valentinus
seems to have copied, after his manner, from the “without form
and void” (ἄμορφος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος) of Genesis<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c008'><sup>[371]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>This Ectroma or abortion of Sophia, however, caused great
alarm to the other members of the Pleroma, who feared that
they might themselves be led into similar lapses, and thus bring
about the destruction of the whole system. They accordingly
importuned Bythos, who ordered that two new aeons, viz.
Christos or Christ and the Holy Spirit, should be put forth by
Nous and Aletheia to give form and direction to the Ectroma
and to alleviate the distress of Sophia<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c008'><sup>[372]</sup></a>. This was accordingly
done, and this new pair of aeons separated Sophia from her
Ectroma and drew her with them within the Pleroma, which
was thereupon closed by the projection by Bythos of yet
another aeon named the Cross (Σταυρός)<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c008'><sup>[373]</sup></a>, whose sole function
was apparently to preserve the Pleroma or Divine World from
all contamination from the imperfection which was outside<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c008'><sup>[374]</sup></a>.
This last aeon being, says Hippolytus, born great, as brought
into existence by a great and perfect father, was put forth as
a guard and circumvallation for the aeons, and became the
boundary of the Pleroma, containing within him all the thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>aeons together. Outside this boundary remained Sophia’s
Ectroma, whom Christ and the Holy Spirit had fashioned into
an aeon as perfect as any within the Pleroma; and she, like her
mother, is now called Sophia, being generally distinguished from
“the last and youngest of the aeons” as the Sophia Without<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c008'><sup>[375]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Sophia Without the Pleroma was by no means at
peace within herself. She is represented as having been
afflicted with great terror at the departure of Christos and the
Holy Spirit from her, when they left her to take their places
within the Pleroma, and as grieving over her solitude and “in
great perplexity” as to the nature of the Holy Spirit. Hence
she turned herself to prayers and supplications to Christos, the
being who had given her form, and these prayers were heard.
Meanwhile, the thirty aeons within the Pleroma had resolved,
on finding themselves safe within the guard of Stauros, to
glorify the Father or Bythos by offering to him one aeon who
should partake of the nature of each, and was therefore called
the “Joint Fruit of the Pleroma<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c008'><sup>[376]</sup></a>.” This was Jesus “the
Great High Priest,” who, on coming into existence was sent
outside the Pleroma at the instance of Christos in order that
he might be a spouse to the Sophia Without and deliver her
from her afflictions<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c008'><sup>[377]</sup></a>. This he did, but the four passions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Sophia, namely, fear, grief, perplexity, and supplication, having
once been created could not be destroyed, but became separate
and independent beings. Thus it was that matter came into
being, and was itself the creation of the Deity, instead of being,
as in the earlier systems, of independent origin. For Jesus
“changed her fear into the substance which is psychic or
animal (οὐσία ψυχικὴ), her grief into that which is hylic or
material, and her perplexity into the substance of demons<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c008'><sup>[378]</sup></a>.”
Of her supplication, however, Jesus made a path of repentance
(ὁδὸν ἐπὶ μετάνοιαν) and gave it power over the psychic substance.
This psychic substance is, says Valentinus, a “consuming
fire” like the God of Moses, and the Demiurge or
Architect of the Cosmos, and is called the “Place” (τόπος)
and the Hebdomad or Sevenfold Power, and the Ancient of
Days, and is, if Hippolytus has really grasped Valentinus’
opinions on the point, the author of death<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c008'><sup>[379]</sup></a>. He and his realm
come immediately below that of Sophia Without, here somewhat
unexpectedly called the Ogdoad, where Sophia dwells with
her spouse Jesus<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c008'><sup>[380]</sup></a>. His sevenfold realm is, it would seem, the
seven astronomical heavens, of which perhaps the Paradise of
Adam is the fourth<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c008'><sup>[381]</sup></a>. Below this again comes this world, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Cosmos, ruled by a hylic or material Power called the Devil
(Διάβολος) or Cosmocrator, not further described by Valentinus
but apparently resembling the Satan of the New Testament<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c008'><sup>[382]</sup></a>.
Lowest of all is unformed and unarranged matter, inhabited by
the demons, of whom Beelzebub, as in the Gospels, is said to
be the chief<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c008'><sup>[383]</sup></a>. We have then four “places” outside the Pleroma
or Godhead, arranged in a succession which reckoning from above
downwards may be thus summed up:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The Heaven of Sophia called the Ogdoad, wherein dwell
Sophia Without and her spouse Jesus<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c008'><sup>[384]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>2. The Sevenfold World called the Hebdomad created and
ruled by the Demiurge or Ancient of Days.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Our own ordered world or Cosmos created by the Demiurge
but ruled by the Devil.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Chaos or unarranged Matter ruled by Beelzebub, Prince
of the Demons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of this may be due to the desire apparently inborn in
natives of Egypt to define with excessive minuteness the topography
of the invisible world; but the disposition of these
different Rulers was by no means a matter of indifference to
mankind. The Demiurge, as in the Ophite system, was not,
indeed, bad, but foolish and blind, not knowing what he did, nor
why he created man. Yet it is he who sends forth the souls of
men which reach them at their birth and leave them at their
death. Hence, says Hippolytus, he is called Psyche or Soul as
Sophia is called Pneuma or Spirit. But this soul of man is little
else than what we call the life, and here as in all else the Demiurge
is controlled without knowing it by his mother Sophia, who
from her place in the Heavenly Jerusalem directs his operations.
The bodies of men the Demiurge makes from that hylic and
diabolic substance which is matter<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c008'><sup>[385]</sup></a>, and the soul which comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>from him dwells within it as in an inn, into which all may enter.
Sometimes, says Valentinus—and in this instance at least we
know it is he, not one of his followers, who is speaking—the
soul dwells alone and sometimes with demons, but sometimes
with Logoi or “words,” who are heavenly angels sent by Sophia
Without and her spouse the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma into
this world, and who dwell with the soul in the earthly body,
when it has no demons living with it.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c008'><sup>[386]</sup></a> After leaving the body
of matter, the soul will even be united with its especial angel in
a still more perfect manner, as is a bridegroom with his bride<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c008'><sup>[387]</sup></a>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>state which is sometimes spoken of as “the Banquet,” and seems
connected with what has been said above about the meeting of
Jesus the Joint Fruit with the Sophia Without<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c008'><sup>[388]</sup></a>. Yet this is
not a question of conduct or free will, but of predestination,
and seems to mark the chief practical difference between
Valentinus on the one hand and the Ophites and the pre-Christian
Gnostics on the other. The Ophites, as we have seen, believed
in the threefold nature of the soul, or its composition from the
pneumatic or spiritual, the psychical or animal, and the choic
or earthly, all which elements were thought to be present in
everyone. But they held, following their predecessors the
Orphici, that these divisions corresponded to what may be
called degrees of grace, and that it was possible for man to
pass from one category to the other, and become wholly pneumatic
or psychic or earthly. Valentinus, however, introduces
a different idea and makes the distinction between the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>different categories of human souls one not of degree, but of
essence<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c008'><sup>[389]</sup></a>. Men have not a threefold soul, but belong to one
of three classes, according to the source of their souls. Either
they are pneumatic, <i>i.e.</i> spiritual, belonging wholly to Sophia,
or psychic, that is animated by the Demiurge alone and therefore
like him foolish and ignorant although capable of improvement,
or hylic, that is formed wholly of matter and therefore subject
to the power of the demons<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c008'><sup>[390]</sup></a>. Nothing is said explicitly by
Hippolytus as to how this division into classes is made; but
we know by other quotations from Valentinus himself that this
is the work of Sophia who sends the Logoi or Words into such
souls as she chooses, or rather into those which she has created
specially and without the knowledge of the Demiurge<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c008'><sup>[391]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The consequences of this division upon the future of mankind
generally also differed materially from that of the Ophitic
scheme. Only the pneumatics or spiritual men are by nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>immortal or deathless, and when they leave the material body
go on high to the Ogdoad or Heaven of Sophia, where she sits
with Jesus the “Joint Fruit” of the Pleroma<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c008'><sup>[392]</sup></a>. The hylics or
men who are wholly material perish utterly at death, because
their souls like their bodies are corruptible<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c008'><sup>[393]</sup></a>. There remain the
psychic—the “natural men” of the New Testament<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c008'><sup>[394]</sup></a>—who are
not so to speak “saved”; but are yet capable of salvation.
How was this salvation to be brought about?</p>

<p class='c007'>Valentinus seems to have answered this by saying, as any
Catholic Christian would have done at the time, that it was
through the Divine Mission of Jesus. Yet this Jesus, according
to Valentinus or the Valentinian author from whom Hippolytus
draws his account, was neither Jesus the Joint Fruit of the
Pleroma, who according to them remained with his spouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Sophia in the Heavenly Jerusalem, nor Christos who with his
consort the Holy Spirit was safe within the Pleroma. He was
in effect a third saviour brought into being especially for the
salvation of all that is worth saving in this devil-ruled and
material world, in the same way that Christos and his consort
had saved the first Sophia after she had given birth to the
monstrous Ectroma, and as Jesus the Joint Fruit had saved
this Ectroma itself. It is very probable, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau has
shown with great attention to detail, that every system, perhaps
every universe, had according to Valentinus its own saviour,
the whole arrangement being part of one vast scheme for the
ordering and purifying of all things<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c008'><sup>[395]</sup></a>. Hence Valentinus explains,
as the Ophites had failed to do, that salvation spreads
from above downwards and that the redemption of this world
was not undertaken until that of the universe of the Demiurge
had been effected<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c008'><sup>[396]</sup></a>. The Demiurge—and the statement has
peculiar significance if we consider him the God of the Jews—had
been taught by Sophia Without that he was not the sole
God, as he had imagined, and had been instructed and “initiated
into the great mystery of the Father and the Aeons<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c008'><sup>[397]</sup></a>.” Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>it is nowhere distinctly stated, it seems a natural inference that
the same lot will fall to the psychic men who are, like the
Demiurge, “soul” rather than “spirit,” and that they will
receive further instruction in the Heaven of Sophia. Thus, he
continues, the lapses<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c008'><sup>[398]</sup></a> of the Demiurge had been set straight and
it was necessary that those here below should go through the
same process. Jesus was accordingly born of the Virgin Mary;
He was entirely pneumatic, that is His body was endowed with
a spiritual soul, for Sophia Without herself descended into Mary
and the germ thus sown by her was formed into a visible shape
by the operation of the Demiurge<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c008'><sup>[399]</sup></a>. As for His Mission, it
seems to have consisted in revealing to man the constitution of
the worlds above him, the course to be pursued by him to attain
immortality, and to sum up the whole matter in one word, the
<i>Gnosis</i> or knowledge that was necessary to salvation<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c008'><sup>[400]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the account of the teaching of Valentinus, which has
been taken almost entirely from the <i>Philosophumena</i> or from
quotations from his own words in trustworthy writers like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Clement of Alexandria, abruptly ends, and we are left to conjecture.
We cannot therefore say directly what Valentinus himself
taught about the Crucifixion. Jesus, the historical Jesus
born of the Virgin Mary, though purely pneumatic or spiritual
at the outset, received according to one account some tincture
of the nature of all the worlds through which He had descended,
and must therefore, probably, have had to abandon successive
parts of His nature, as He reascended<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c008'><sup>[401]</sup></a>. Probably, therefore,
Valentinus thought that the Spiritual or Divine part of Him
left Him before the Passion, and that it was only His material
body that suffered<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c008'><sup>[402]</sup></a>. As we shall see later, this idea was much
elaborated by the later Gnostics, who thought that all those
redeemed from this world would in that respect have to imitate
their Great Exemplar. If this be so, it is plain that it was
only that part of the soul of Jesus which He had received from
Sophia which returned to her, and was doubtless re-absorbed
in her being. Yet there is nothing to make us believe that
Valentinus did not accept the narrative of the Canonical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Gospels in full<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c008'><sup>[403]</sup></a>, or to doubt that he taught that Jesus really
suffered on the Cross, although he doubtless interpreted this
in his usual fashion, by making it a symbol of the self-sacrifice
of Jesus the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma, when He left that
celestial abode to give form and salvation to the miserable
Ectroma of Sophia<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c008'><sup>[404]</sup></a>. Here again we can but gather Valentinus’
opinions from those of his followers, who may have altered
them materially to fit them to the exigencies of a situation of
which we can form no very precise idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these followers we know rather more than in the case of
any other of the early heresiarchs. According to Tertullian,
Valentinus was brought up as a Christian, and expected to
become a bishop of the Catholic Church, “because he was an
able man both in genius and eloquence<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c008'><sup>[405]</sup></a>.” Finding, Tertullian
goes on to say, that a confessor<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c008'><sup>[406]</sup></a> was preferred to him, he broke
with the Church and “finding the track of a certain old opinion”
(doubtless, the Ophite) “marked out a path for himself.” The
same accusation of disappointed ambition was levelled against
nearly every other heresiarch at the time, and may serve to
show how greatly the place of bishop was coveted; but we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>no means of judging its truth in this particular instance, and it
is repeated neither by Irenaeus, Hippolytus, nor Clement of
Alexandria who was in an exceptionally good position for knowing
the truth of the case. Irenaeus, however, says that Valentinus
came to Rome during the papacy of Hyginus, flourished
(ἤκμασε) under that of Pius, and dwelt there until that of
Anicetus; and this is confirmed by Eusebius, who connects
Valentinus’ stay in Rome with the reign of Hadrian’s successor,
Antoninus Pius<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c008'><sup>[407]</sup></a>. Tertullian further declares that Valentinus did
not separate from the Church until the papacy of Eleutherus<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c008'><sup>[408]</sup></a>,
which did not commence until <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 174, and <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau
seems therefore well-founded in his inference that Valentinus
elaborated his system in Egypt while yet in the Church, and
that he went to Rome in order to impose it upon the rest of the
faithful<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c008'><sup>[409]</sup></a>. If this be so, it would abundantly account for its
far closer approximation to the orthodox faith than that of
the Ophites, from which it appears to have been derived.
Epiphanius tells us further that after quitting Rome, Valentinus
died in Cyprus, where he made “a last shipwreck of his faith<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c008'><sup>[410]</sup></a>.”
Could we place implicit faith in Epiphanius’ highly-coloured
statements, we might gather from this that Valentinus gave a
fresh turn to his doctrines after finding himself away from the
great cities in which he had hitherto spent his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>However that may be, the time which, on the shortest
computation, Valentinus passed in Rome was quite sufficient
for him to set up a school there, and we are not surprised to hear
that thereafter there was a body of Valentinians in the West,
which was called the “Italic school.” Innovating, as Tertullian
said all heretics did, upon the system of their founder, they
taught, as before mentioned, that Sige or Silence was a real
spouse to the Ineffable Bythos or the Supreme Being and existed
side by side with Him from eternity<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c008'><sup>[411]</sup></a>. They further said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the Dodecad or group of twelve aeons, of whom Sophia was the
last, emanated not from Logos and Zoe, but from the third
syzygy of Anthropos and Ecclesia<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c008'><sup>[412]</sup></a>; and that the body of the
historical Jesus was not material but psychic or from the world
of the Demiurge<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c008'><sup>[413]</sup></a>, which seems to include the view held by other
Gnostics that it was a phantasm which only appeared to suffer
on the Cross, but did not do so in reality. We know the names of
several of the leaders of this Italic school, among whom were
Ptolemy, Secundus, and Heracleon. It was the doctrine of the
first of these apparently flourishing in Gaul in his time, which
spurred on Irenaeus to write against them<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c008'><sup>[414]</sup></a>; while Heracleon
was called by Clement of Alexandria the most distinguished of
the school of Valentinus and taught in the last-named city<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c008'><sup>[415]</sup></a>.
Ptolemy’s doctrine as described by Irenaeus seems to have
materially differed from that of his master only in the particulars
just given; while Secundus is said by the same heresiologist to
have divided the First Ogdoad into two tetrads, a right hand
and a left, one of which he called light and the other darkness<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c008'><sup>[416]</sup></a>.
Over against this, we hear from Hippolytus of an Eastern
school (Διδασκαλία ἀνατολικὴ), which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau shows
satisfactorily to have most closely represented the teaching of
Valentinus himself<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c008'><sup>[417]</sup></a>, and which was carried on after his death
by Axionicus and Bardesanes<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c008'><sup>[418]</sup></a>. Of these, Axionicus is said to
have taught in his native city of Antioch; while Bardesanes was
evidently the same as the person called by the Syrians Bar
Daisan of Edessa, whose name was still great in the time of
Albiruni<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c008'><sup>[419]</sup></a>. Theodotus, whose writings are quoted at some
length by Clement of Alexandria, and Alexander, whose arguments
as to the body of Jesus are rebutted by Tertullian,
probably continued their teaching<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c008'><sup>[420]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The life of Bar Daisan, of which some particulars have been
preserved for us by Bar Hebraeus and other Eastern historians
of the Church, throws considerable light upon the attitude
towards Christianity of Valentinus and that Anatolic School
which best represented his teachings. Bar Daisan was born some
fifty years after Valentinus of rich and noble parents in the town
of Edessa in Mesopotamia, where he seems to have been educated
in the company of the future king of the country, Abgar
Bar Manu<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c008'><sup>[421]</sup></a>. He was probably a Christian from his infancy, early
became a Christian teacher, and withstood Apollonius, a Pagan
Sophist who visited Edessa in the train of the Emperor Caracalla,
making avowal of his readiness to suffer martyrdom for
the faith. According to Eusebius, he had the greatest abhorrence
of the dualistic doctrine of Marcion and wrote books against
him in his native Syriac which were afterwards translated into
Greek<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c008'><sup>[422]</sup></a>. He, or perhaps his son Harmonius<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c008'><sup>[423]</sup></a>, also composed
a great number of hymns which were sung in the Catholic
Churches of Mesopotamia and Syria; and it was not until a
century and a half after his death that Ephrem Syrus, a doctor
of the now triumphant and persecuting Church, found that
these abounded in the errors of Valentinus, and deemed it
necessary to substitute for them hymns of his own composition<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c008'><sup>[424]</sup></a>.
Valentinus seems in like manner to have lived in Rome as a
Christian teacher, as we have seen, for at least sixteen years,
and to have composed many psalms, some of which are quoted
by Clement of Alexandria. If Tertullian is to be believed, he
was qualified for the episcopate, which he must have had some
chance of obtaining; and his want of orthodoxy cannot,
therefore, have been manifest at the time or considered an
objection to his candidature<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c008'><sup>[425]</sup></a>. Moreover, Irenaeus says that
Valentinus was the first who converted the so-called Gnostic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>heresy into the peculiar characteristics of his own school<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c008'><sup>[426]</sup></a>;
which agrees with Tertullian’s statement that Valentinus was
“at first a believer in the teaching of the Catholic Church in
the Church of Rome under the episcopate of the Blessed
Eleutherus<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c008'><sup>[427]</sup></a>.” It is evident, therefore, that long after his
peculiar teaching was developed, he remained a member of the
Church, and that it was not by his own wish that he left it, if
indeed he ever did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>One is therefore led to examine with some closeness the
alleged differences between his teaching and that of the orthodox
Christianity of his time; and these, although they may have
been vitally important, seem to have been very few. With
regard to his views as to the nature of the Godhead, as given
above, they do indeed seem to differ <span lang="la"><i>toto coelo</i></span> from those
shadowed forth in the Canonical Gospels and Epistles, and
afterwards defined and emphasized by the many Œcumenical
and other Councils called to regulate the Church’s teaching on
the matter. The long series of aeons constituting his Pleroma or
Fulness of the Godhead seems at first sight to present the most
marked contrast with the Trinity of Three Persons and One
God in the Creeds which have come down to us from the early
Church. But is there any reason to suppose that Valentinus
regarded the members of these Tetrads, Decads, and Dodecads
as possessing a separate and individual existence or as having
any practical importance for the Christian? We can hardly
suppose so, when we consider the attitude of his immediate
followers with regard to them. Some, as we have seen, were
said to have put as the origin of all things, not a single principle
but two principles of different sexes or, as Irenaeus says, a
“dyad,” thereby splitting the Supreme Being into two<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c008'><sup>[428]</sup></a>. We can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>imagine the outcry that this would have caused two centuries
later when the different parties within the Christian Church
were at each other’s throats on the question whether the Son
was of the same or only of like substance with the Father.
Yet neither Valentinus, nor Ptolemy, nor Heracleon, nor any
one of the Valentinian leaders seems to have borne the others
any hostility on that account, to have dreamed of separating
from them on such a pretext, or to have ceased to regard themselves
both as Christians and followers of Valentinus. The
only inference to be drawn from this is either that the account
of their teaching has been grossly corrupted or that they considered
such questions as matters of opinion merely, on which
all might freely debate, but which were not to be taken as
touchstones of the faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view derives great support from the way in which
Clement of Alexandria, Valentinus’ countryman and the one
among the Fathers who seems best fitted to understand him,
regarded similar questions. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Courdaveaux has shown with
great clearness that Clement sometimes confounded the Third
Person of the Trinity with the Second, and sometimes made
Him His inferior. He also considered the Son as a simple
creature of the Father, and, therefore, necessarily, of lower
rank<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c008'><sup>[429]</sup></a>. It was for such “heresies,” as they were afterwards
called, that Photius, who had Clement’s now lost book of the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> under his eyes, condemned him as a heretic,
although his judgment in the matter has never been adopted
by the Church. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Courdaveaux also shows that Tertullian,
even before he left the Church, looked upon both the Son and
the Holy Spirit as only “members” of the Father, whom he
considered to contain within Himself the complete divine substance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and this was certainly none of the heresies for which
his memory was arraigned<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c008'><sup>[430]</sup></a>. It by no means follows that
Valentinus’ teaching was the same as that of the Church in all
its details; but it seems possible from these examples that he
did not think it necessary to be more definite than the Church
herself upon such points, and that he did not look upon them in
any other light than as matters of opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should also be considered whether the language that Valentinus
used regarding the nature and divisions of the Godhead
is to be construed in the same sense and as implying the meaning
that it would have done a few centuries later, when these
points had been long discussed and the reasons for and against
them marshalled and weighed. So far as can now be seen,
he, like all Egyptians, never lost sight of allegory in dealing
with matters transcending sense. Thus, when he speaks of
the pretended union of Bythos and Sige, he is careful to say that
there is nothing actually begotten, and that the whole story
must be considered in a figurative sense:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Father [<i>i.e.</i> Bythos] alone,” he says, “was unbegotten,
not subject to conditions of place, nor time, taking no counsel, nor
having any other being that can be comprehended by any recognized
trope: but he was alone, and, as it is said, solitary, and resting in
solitary repose within himself. And when he became fruitful, it
seemed to him good at a certain time to engender and bring forth
the most beautiful and perfect thing which he had within him:
for he did not love solitude. For he was all love, but love is not
love unless there is something to be loved<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c008'><sup>[431]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Between this and such Canonical texts as “God is love, and he
that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c008'><sup>[432]</sup></a>,” there
may be a difference of application indeed, but none of language.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems, therefore, that in his theology Valentinus treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the Ophitic ideas on which he worked very much as the Ophites
had themselves treated the legends of Osiris and Attis. Dealing
with their stories of aeons and powers as myths—that is to say
as legends which whether true or not were only to be considered
as symbols designed to show the way in which the world and man
came forth from God—he thereby established his cosmology on
a foundation which could be considered satisfactory by those
half-heathen schools which had already contrived to reconcile
the Pagan rites with the Jewish Scriptures and the Christian
belief in the Mission of Jesus. But he went far beyond them
in applying the same method of interpretation to all the acts
of Jesus recorded in the Gospels. If Jesus were crucified upon
the Cross, it was because its type the aeon Stauros had been set
as a limit between that which is God and that which is not
God but only godlike<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c008'><sup>[433]</sup></a>. If He is said to go up to Jerusalem,
it means that He went up from the world of matter to the
Heaven of Sophia which is called Jerusalem<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c008'><sup>[434]</sup></a>. If He were sent
down to earth, it was because the higher worlds had already
been put in the way of redemption by the gathering-in of
Sophia into the Pleroma, the marriage of Sophia Without to
Jesus the Joint Fruit, and the revelation to the Demiurge or
God of the Jews that he was not the Supreme Being but only
his reflection at several removes<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c008'><sup>[435]</sup></a>. Every world is a copy of
the one above it, every event must take place in every world
in its turn, and all creation is like a chain which hung from
the heavens is gradually drawn up to them, this creation of ours
(κτίσις καθ’ ἡμᾶς) being its last link<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c008'><sup>[436]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all this, Valentinus wrote like a philosopher of the period,
and, in fact, pretty much as Philo had done. But beyond this,
he seems to have paid great attention to what is called the
“pastoral” duty of a religious teacher or the care of souls, and
to have busied himself to show how religion could be used to
console and sustain the heart. All the fragments that we have
left of the writings of himself and his followers are directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>towards this end; and would, from this point of view, do credit
to any doctor of the Church. This is especially the case with
the passage formerly quoted likening the human heart to an
inn, of which Clement of Alexandria gives the actual words as
follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is one good by whose coming is the manifestation, which
is by the Son, and by Him alone can the heart become pure, by
the expulsion of every evil spirit from the heart. For the multitude
of spirits dwelling in it do not suffer it to be pure; but each of
them performs his own deeds, insulting it often with unseemly
lusts. And the heart seems to be treated somewhat like the courtyard
of an inn. For the latter has holes and ruts in it, and is often
filled with dung; men living filthily in it, and taking no care for
the place because it belongs to others. So fares it with the heart
as long as no thought is taken for it, and it is unclean and many
demons dwell therein. But when the one good Father visits it,
it is sanctified and gleams with light. And he who possesses such
a heart is so blessed, that he shall see God<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c008'><sup>[437]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is no wonder that <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau speaks in terms of admiration
of the eloquence with which Valentinus applies himself to
the problem of the existence of evil, and that Neander should
say that he in great measure realized the idea of Christianity<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c008'><sup>[438]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems indeed plain that Valentinus never intended to
break with the Catholic Church and that it is not likely that
he would have attempted during his life to found any organization
that would have been in any way hostile to her<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c008'><sup>[439]</sup></a>. Hence
it is in vain to search for any special rites belonging to the sect;
and it is most probable that he and his immediate followers
continued to worship with the orthodox, and to resort to the
priests of the Church at large for the administration of the
Church’s sacraments. Did they however demand any formal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>initiation into their own doctrines or, in other words, attempt
to keep them in any sense secret? One can only say that there
is no proof that they did so. Clement of Alexandria and Origen
both quote freely from the books written by Valentinus and his
follower Heracleon in which their doctrines are openly set forth,
and do not hint at any special difficulty they may have had in
obtaining them. Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus do the
same thing with regard to the writings of Valentinus and Ptolemy,
and Irenaeus tells us that he has obtained his knowledge of their
doctrines not only by reading their commentaries (on Scripture)
but by personal conversation with their disciples<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c008'><sup>[440]</sup></a>. It does not,
therefore, look as if before the legal procedure of the State or
the more summary methods of the Christian mob could be used
by the Catholics for the suppression of opinion and discussion,
the Valentinians ever tried to do what Basilides had recommended
to his followers, and to found what was really a secret
society either within or without the bosom of the Church<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c008'><sup>[441]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not follow from this, however, that the Valentinians
differed only in trifling points from the orthodox, or that the
Fathers were wrong when they accused them of working grave
injury to the nascent Church. The compliances with heathenism
which they allowed those who thought with them, such as
attendance at the circus and the theatres, partaking of heathen
sacrifices, and flight or even the denial of their faith in time of
persecution<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c008'><sup>[442]</sup></a>, although justified by them with texts, such as:
“That which is of the flesh is flesh; and that which is of the
Spirit is Spirit,” must have aroused the most bitter hostility
from those wise governors of the Church who saw clearly
whither the struggle between the Church and the Roman Empire
was tending. The reward most constantly before the eyes of
those about to obtain what was called “the crown” of martyrdom
was that by thus giving their lives for the faith they would
immediately after death become united with the Deity, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of waiting like other Christians for the Last Judgment<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c008'><sup>[443]</sup></a>. Hence,
intending martyrs were regarded even while yet alive with
extraordinary reverence by the rest of the faithful, who, as we
know from heathen as well as Christian writers, were in the habit
of flocking into the prisons after them, weeping over them and
kissing their fetters, and deeming it a privilege to minister in
every way to the necessities of those who might by a sort of
anticipation be regarded as already Divine<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c008'><sup>[444]</sup></a>. It was on this
veritable army of martyrs and on the enthusiasm which their
triumphs excited that the Church mainly relied for victory in
her warfare with the State. But how was this army to be
recruited if the ideas of Valentinus once gained the upper hand
in the Christian community, and it came to be thought that the
same reward could be gained by acquaintance with the relative
positions of the heavens and their rulers, and an accurate
knowledge of the constitution of the universe? It was in time
of persecution that the Valentinians oftenest found adherents—“then
the Gnostics break out, then the Valentinians creep
forth, then all the opponents of martyrdom bubble up,” as
Tertullian describes it<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c008'><sup>[445]</sup></a>; and it is easy to understand that those
who had most to lose in position or ease of life would grasp
eagerly at any intermediate course which would enable them
to keep their faith in the religion recently revealed to them
without going through the terrible trials to which their orthodox
teachers sought to subject them. Hence, the Valentinians
probably in some sort justified Gibbon’s remark that “the
Gnostics were distinguished as the most polite, the most learned,
and the most wealthy of the Christian name<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c008'><sup>[446]</sup></a>”; and this alone
would probably account for the undying hostility which the
Church always exhibited towards them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also the case that the spread of the tenets of Valentinus
and his followers was attended with some peculiar social
dangers of its own. Their division of mankind into the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>natural classes of spiritual, psychical, and hylic, if carried to
its logical conclusion, brought with it some strange results. As
the spiritual or pneumatics were saved in any event, and were,
already even in this life, as was expressly said, a kind of “gods,”
it was manifestly not for them to trouble themselves about
obedience to the moral law. The same conclusion applied to the
hylics who were doomed to annihilation in any case, and whose
struggles towards righteousness were bound to be inefficacious.
There remained the psychics or animal men, for whom indeed
a certain course of life was prescribed before they could attain
salvation. But with the excessive freedom of interpretation and
the licence of variation that Valentinus apparently allowed his
followers, the exact limits of this course must always have been
a matter of doubt; and it was here that many corruptions and
debasements of his teaching began to show themselves. For it
was an age when religious impostors of all kinds found an easy
market in the credulity of their fellows, and charlatans everywhere
abounded who were ready to support their claims to exclusive
knowledge of holy things by false miracles and juggling
tricks. Hippolytus gives us a long list of such devices including
the means of answering questions in sealed letters,
producing an apparition, and the like, which he declares the
heresiarchs learnt from the magicians and used as proof of their
own doctrines<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c008'><sup>[447]</sup></a>. One knows at any rate from Lucian’s evidence
that religious pretenders like Alexander of Abonoteichos were
not negligent of such practices, and charlatans of his kind were
perhaps especially likely to be attracted to the timid and wealthy
followers of Valentinus. A Valentinian impostor of this sort,
if the Fathers are to be believed, was the Jewish magician
Marcus, who taught a system corresponding in most points
with that given above, but made use of it in his own interest
as a means of moneymaking and for the corruption of women.
Irenaeus speaks of the doctrine of this Marcus as being an
especial snare to the Christians of Gaul, into which country
Marcus or some follower of his perhaps travelled while Irenaeus
was Bishop of Lyons<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c008'><sup>[448]</sup></a>. By a mode of interpretation which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>indeed a caricature of Valentinus’ own, Marcus found proof of the
existence and order of his aeons in the values of the letters composing
Divine names and in words like Jesus and Christos<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c008'><sup>[449]</sup></a>. He
seems, too, to have himself administered baptism accompanied
by exorcisms in the Hebrew language, and to have profaned the
Eucharist with juggling tricks which made the cup to overflow
and turned the water it contained into wine having the semblance
of blood<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c008'><sup>[450]</sup></a>. Thus, says Irenaeus, he contrived to draw away a
great number from the Church and to seduce many of the
faithful women. Valentinus, perhaps, is somewhat unfairly
held responsible by the Fathers for such a perversion of his own
teaching which he would, perhaps, have condemned as loudly
as they. Scandals of the kind here hinted at were not unknown
in the Catholic Church itself, and Christian ministers have been
found in all ages, sects, and countries who have been willing to
abuse for their own purposes the power which religion gives
them over the opposite sex. It is true, too, that people, as
has been well said, are seldom either as good or as bad as their
creed, and the doctrine that “God sees no sin in His elect”
has been preached in our own time without being followed by
the “wretchlessness of most unclean living” which the <abbr title='seventeenth'>17th</abbr>
article of the Church of England declares to be one of the
probable consequences of predestinarian teaching. The later
Valentinians certainly did not forbid marriage, as is shown by
the pathetic epitaph from a grave in the Via Nazionale quoted
by Renan<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c008'><sup>[451]</sup></a>, and thus avoided some of the moral dangers with
which the practice of celibacy is sometimes reproached.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the fortunes of the Valentinian sect after the death of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Valentinus, we have very little precise information. Tertullian
speaks of it as being in his time the most numerous society of
heretics (<span lang="la"><i>frequentissimum plane collegium haereticorum</i></span>), and in
the West it extended from Rome, as we have seen, into Gaul
and even into Spain, where it existed at the end of the 4th
century<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c008'><sup>[452]</sup></a>. Probably, however, it here propagated itself sporadically,
its opinions appearing now and then among isolated
writers and teachers, who probably drew their disciples carefully
from among the Christian community, and only disclosed their
system to those who showed some aptitude for it. Of such was
doubtless “my fair sister Flora” (ἀδελφή μου καλὴ Φλώρα),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to whom Valentinus’ successor Ptolemy wrote a letter setting
out his tenets which Epiphanius has preserved for us<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c008'><sup>[453]</sup></a>. As the
quotations in it presuppose an acquaintance on her part with
Old Testament history as well as with the Canonical Gospels
and the Pauline Epistles, there can be little doubt that she was
already a Christian convert. This mode of propaganda was
the more obnoxious to the episcopate that it was likely to
escape for some time the observation of the overseers of the
Church, and is quite sufficient to explain the pains which bishops
like Irenaeus and Hippolytus took to expose and refute the
doctrines of the Valentinians, as well as what they say with
doubtful accuracy about the secrecy which was observed concerning
them<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c008'><sup>[454]</sup></a>. In the East, things were probably different,
and Heracleon’s Commentaries on the Gospels, from which
Origen quotes freely, would on the face of it have been useless
unless addressed to the Christian community at large, and
make no attempt to conceal their heretical teaching. In Egypt,
however, the Gnostic teachers found a soil ready prepared for
them. Egyptian Christianity, whether founded, according to
tradition, by <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Mark or not, never seems to have gone through
the intermediate stage of observing the prescriptions of the
Jewish Law while preaching its abrogation, and, in Alexandria
especially, so far appealed to those learned in the Hellenistic
and other philosophies as to necessitate the founding of a
Christian school there for their study. The native Egyptians,
too, had for millennia been given to mystic speculation about
the nature of God and the destiny of the soul after death;
and Valentinus, who must be presumed to have understood his
own people, doubtless knew how to suit his teaching to their
comprehension, even if he did not incorporate therein, as
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau has endeavoured to show, some of the more
abstruse doctrines on these points of the old Egyptian religion<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c008'><sup>[455]</sup></a>.
Moreover, from the time of Hadrian onwards, the Egyptians
were animated by a bitter and restless hatred against their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Roman masters, and this feeling, which was by no means without
justification, disposed them to embrace eagerly any ideas
condemned by the bishops and clergy of Rome and of Constantinople.
Hence the Valentinians had in Egypt their greatest
chance of success, and the existence of documents like those
described in the next chapter shows that Egyptian Christianity
must have been largely permeated by their ideas perhaps up
to Mohammedan times. Further East, the same causes produced
similar effects, though in this case they were probably
modified by the necessity of combating the remains of heathen
religions which there lingered. The growing political power
of the Catholic Church even before the conversion of Constantine
probably drove the Valentinians to form separate communities
wherever they were in sufficient numbers to do so, and thus is
explained the possession by them of the “houses of prayer”
of which the Constantinian Decree above quoted professes to
deprive them. On the confines of the Empire and in provinces
so far distant from the capital as Mesopotamia, these heretical
communities probably lingered longer than in other places, and
may have enjoyed, as in the case of Bardesanes, the protection
and countenance of the native kinglets. Even here, however,
the employment of the secular arm which its alliance with the
State gave to the Church seems to have eventually forced them
into an attitude of hostility towards it, as is shown by the
“rabbling” of one of their conventicles in the way before
mentioned. The accession of Julian brought them a temporary
respite<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c008'><sup>[456]</sup></a>; but on his death in the Persian campaign, the retreat
of the Roman eagles probably gave them their quietus. Only
in Egypt, it would seem, did their doctrines succeed in gaining
anything like a permanent resting-place. Elsewhere, the rise
of new heresies and especially of Manichaeism drove them out
of their last strongholds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Valentinianism, therefore, approved itself a stop-gap or
temporary faith, which for two hundred years<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c008'><sup>[457]</sup></a> acted as a halfway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>house between heathenism and Christianity. In this
capacity, it was singularly efficient, and was one of the forces
which enabled, as Renan said, the ancient world to change
from Paganism to Christianity without knowing it. In particular,
it seems to have attracted to itself the attention of the
learned and leisured class who were endeavouring, earnestly if
somewhat timidly, to work out a rule of faith and conduct from
the welter of creeds and philosophies with which the Empire
was swamped during the first Christian centuries. Such a class
is not that out of which martyrs are made, and is sure sooner
or later to acquiesce in the opinions of the majority; but we
may be certain that the learned and polite Valentinians would
have listened with natural disgust to the simple and enthusiastic
declamations of Jewish fishermen and artizans which had
for their chief theme the coming destruction and overthrow of
the social system in which they had grown up. The brilliant,
if baseless, speculations of Valentinus, which even now have
a certain attraction for the lovers of mysticism<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c008'><sup>[458]</sup></a>, gave them
exactly the kind of spiritual <i>pabulum</i> they craved for, and
enabled them to wait in hope and patience until Christianity,
forcing its way upward, as religions generally do, from the lowest
class of society, had become the faith of the governing ranks.
In this way, Valentinianism was probably one of the best
recruiting grounds for the Catholic Church, and Renan is
doubtless right when he says that no one who passed from
Paganism through the Gnosticism of Valentinus and his fellows
ever reverted to his former faith. Yet Valentinianism itself was
doomed to but a short life, and in its original form probably did
not survive its founder by much more than a century and a half.
One of its later developments we shall see in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1765, the British Museum purchased from the celebrated
antiquarian, Dr Askew, a parchment <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> written in Coptic<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c008'><sup>[460]</sup></a>.
On palaeographic grounds it is said to be not earlier than the
<abbr title='sixth'>VIth</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, which agrees fairly with its state of preservation
and the fact that it is written on both sides of the
skins so as to present the appearance of a modern book<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c008'><sup>[461]</sup></a>.
Woide, then librarian of the Museum and pastor of the King’s
German Chapel at <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> James’, published some extracts from
it in his <i>Appendix to the Codex Alexandrinus</i> in 1799, and
Dulaurier gave others in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> in 1847<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c008'><sup>[462]</sup></a>. It
remained, however, untranslated until 1850, when Maurice
Schwartze, a young German scholar who was sent over here to
study our <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> at the expense of the king of Prussia, turned it
into Latin; and he having died soon after, his translation was
published the following year by the learned Petermann. The
British Museum text is written throughout in the Sahidic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>dialect; and is the work of more than one scribe; but it seems
to be agreed by those who have studied it with knowledge
that the documents it contains are neither continuous nor
necessarily related; and that it is in fact a series of extracts
from earlier <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr><a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c008'><sup>[463]</sup></a> Of these documents, the second commences
with a heading, in a handwriting other than that of the scribe
of this part, reading “the Second Book of Pistis Sophia”;
but as such a heading implies that the foregoing document
was the First Book of Pistis Sophia, the whole <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> is generally
known by that name<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c008'><sup>[464]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story presented in these two documents, although
uncompleted, is, so far as it goes, perfectly consistent, and
presupposes belief in a Gnostic system resembling at once
those of the Ophites and of Valentinus. An introduction in
narrative form informs us that Jesus, after rising from the
dead, spent eleven years in teaching His disciples the arrangement
of the heavenly places “only so far as the places” of
a power whom He calls “the First Mystery,” and declares to
be “before all mysteries,” and to be “within the veil,” being
“the father of the likeness of a dove<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c008'><sup>[465]</sup></a>.” The result of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>limitation was, we are told, that the disciples were ignorant
not only that any power existed higher than the First Mystery,
but also of the origin of the “places” or worlds of those
material and <i>quasi</i>-material powers who, here as in the earlier
systems, are responsible for the governance of the world and
the fate of mankind. While the disciples are sitting with
Jesus on the Mount of Olives, however, He is carried away
from them into Heaven by a great “power” or shape of light
which descends upon Him. On His return, He tells them that
this shape was “a vesture of light” or His heavenly nature
which He had laid aside before being born into this world<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c008'><sup>[466]</sup></a>. He
also informs them that, when He first came into this world
before His Incarnation, He brought with Him twelve powers
which He took from “the Twelve Saviours of the Treasure
house of Light<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c008'><sup>[467]</sup></a>,” and planted them in the mothers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>twelve Apostles, so that when these last were born into the
world they were given these powers instead of receiving, like
other men, souls “from the archons (or rulers) of the aeons<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c008'><sup>[468]</sup></a>.”
He also describes how He appeared among the archons of
the Sphere in the likeness of the angel Gabriel, and found
among them the soul of “Elijah the Prophet<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c008'><sup>[469]</sup></a>.” This He
caused to be taken to “the Virgin of Light,” that it might
be planted in Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c008'><sup>[470]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and He adds that He bound to it a power which He took from
“the Little Iao the Good, who is in the middle.” The object
of this was, we are told, that John the Baptist might prepare
the way of Jesus and baptize with water for the remission
of sins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jesus then proceeds to describe His own Incarnation.
When speaking, still in the shape of the angel Gabriel, with
Mary His “mother after the body of matter,” He planted in
her the first power he had received from “Barbelo,” which
was the body He had worn “in the height<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c008'><sup>[471]</sup></a>”; and, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>place of the soul, a power which He received from “the Great
Sabaoth the Good, who is in the place of the right.” After
this digression, He resumes His account of what happened
after His receiving the vesture of light on the Mount of Olives,
and declares that He found written in this vesture five mysterious
words “belonging [viz. in the language of] to the height<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c008'><sup>[472]</sup></a>,”
which He interprets to His disciples thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The mystery who is without the world, through whom all things
exist, he is the giving forth and the lifting up of all and he has put
forth all the emanations and the things which are in them all. And
it is through him that all the mysteries exist and all their places.
Come unto us, for we are thy fellows and thy members<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c008'><sup>[473]</sup></a>! We
are one with thee, for thou and we are one. This is the First
Mystery which existed since the beginning in the Ineffable One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>before he [<i>i.e.</i> the First Mystery] went forth, and we all are his
name<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c008'><sup>[474]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now therefore we all await thee at the last boundary which
is the last mystery from within<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c008'><sup>[475]</sup></a>. This also is part of us. Now
therefore we have sent to thee thy vesture which is thine from the
beginning, which thou didst place in the last boundary, which is
the last boundary from within, until the time should be fulfilled
according to the commandment of the First Mystery. And now
that the time is fulfilled, clothe thyself in it! Come unto us, for
we all stand near to thee that we may clothe thee with all the glory
of the First Mystery by His command. Which glory is as two
vestures, besides that which we have sent unto thee. For thou
art worthy of them since thou art preferred before us and wast
made before us. Wherefore the First Mystery has sent thee by us
the mystery of all his glory, which is as two vestures. In the first
is the glory of all the names of all the mysteries and of all the emanations
which are in the ranks of the receptacles of the Ineffable One.
And in the second vesture is the glory of the names of all the
mysteries and of all the emanations which are in the ranks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>two receptacles of the First Mystery. And in this vesture which
we have sent thee now, is the glory of the name of the Recorder
who is the First Precept<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c008'><sup>[476]</sup></a>, and the mystery of the Five Marks<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c008'><sup>[477]</sup></a>, and
the mystery of the great Legate of the Ineffable One who is the
same as that Great Light<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c008'><sup>[478]</sup></a>, and the mystery of the Five Prohegumeni
who are the same as the Five Parastatae<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c008'><sup>[479]</sup></a>. And there is also in
that vesture the glory of the name of the mystery of all the ranks
of the emanations of the Treasure-house of Light, and of their
Saviours, and the ranks of those ranks which are the Seven Amen
and which are the Seven Sounds, and also the Five Trees<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c008'><sup>[480]</sup></a> and also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the Three Amen, and also the Saviour of the Twins who is the boy
of a boy<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c008'><sup>[481]</sup></a>, and the mystery of the Nine Guards of the Three Gates
of the Treasure-house of Light. And there is also within it the
glory of the name which is on the right, and of all those who are
in the middle. And there also is the glory of the name of the Great
Unseen One, who is the Great Forefather<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c008'><sup>[482]</sup></a>, and the mysteries of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Three Triple Powers, and the mystery of all their places, and the
mystery of all their unseen ones, and of all the dwellers in the
Thirteenth Aeon, and the name of the Twelve Aeons with all their
Archons, all their Archangels, all their Angels and all the dwellers
in the Twelve Aeons, and all the mystery of the name of all the
dwellers in Heimarmene<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c008'><sup>[483]</sup></a>, and all the heavens, and the whole
mystery of the name of all the dwellers in the Sphere and their
firmaments with all they contain and their places. Lo, then, we
have sent unto thee this vesture, which none knoweth from the
First Precept downward, because that the glory of its light was
hidden within it, and the Spheres and all the places from the First
Precept downward knew it not. Hasten, then, do on the vesture,
and come unto us, for we have remained near thee to clothe thee
with these two vestures by the command of the First Mystery
until the time fixed by the Ineffable One should be fulfilled. Now,
then, the time is fulfilled. Come unto us quickly, that we may
clothe thee with them until thou hast accomplished the entire
ministry of the completion of the First Mystery, the ministry
which has been laid upon thee by the Ineffable One. Come then
unto us quickly in order that we may clothe thee with them according
to the command of the First Mystery. For yet a little
while, a very little while, and thou wilt cease to be in the world.
Come then quickly, that thou mayest receive all the glory which
is the glory of the First Mystery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This long address, in which the whole arrangement of the
universe as the author supposes it to exist is set forth, is
clearly the utterance of the heavenly powers belonging to the
higher worlds whom Jesus has left on His descent to earth.
Unintelligible as it seems at first sight, it can be explained
to some extent by the tenets of the Ophites described in
<a href='#chap08'>Chapter <abbr title='eight'>VIII</abbr></a>, which formed, as we have seen, the basis on
which Valentinus also constructed his system. The Ineffable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>One may be assumed to be the Bythos whom both the Ophites
and Valentinus called by that epithet<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c008'><sup>[484]</sup></a> and held to be the
first and final source of all being. Although something
is said here and elsewhere in the book of his “receptacles”
and “places<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c008'><sup>[485]</sup></a>,” no particulars of them are given, they being
apparently reserved for a future revelation<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c008'><sup>[486]</sup></a>. The First
Mystery, however, is spoken of later as a “Twin Mystery,
looking inward and outward<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c008'><sup>[487]</sup></a>,” which seems to correspond
to the Father-and-Son of the Ophite diagram. Later in
the book, Jesus reveals to His disciples that He Himself is
the First Mystery “looking outward<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c008'><sup>[488]</sup></a>,” and this seems to
show that the author’s conception of the relations between
Him and the First Person of the Trinity did not differ much
from that of the Catholic Church<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c008'><sup>[489]</sup></a>. The world of this First
Mystery extends downwards as far as what is here, as in the
Epistle to the Hebrews<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c008'><sup>[490]</sup></a>, called “the veil,” which is perhaps
the veil of sense separating all things contaminated by mixture
with matter from the Divine. This First Mystery is said to
consist of twenty-four “mysteries”; but these do not seem
to be, as in the older systems, places or worlds, but rather
attributes or aspects of the Deity which together go to make
up His whole being, as a number of letters are required to
make up a word or name<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c008'><sup>[491]</sup></a>. But from some words of Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>given later in the book, it would appear that its author did
not at all discard the view of the earlier Ophites that the
Supreme Being was to be figured as of human form, for we
find him remarking that the First Mystery himself proceeded
from the “last limb” or member of the Ineffable One<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c008'><sup>[492]</sup></a>. For
the rest, it need only be pointed out here that the powers who
address Jesus in the quotation just given also speak of
themselves as His “members”; but that notwithstanding
this, they must be looked upon as purely spiritual entities
having no direct connection with any material forms except
as paradigms or patterns<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c008'><sup>[493]</sup></a>. Whatever the worlds which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>inhabit may be thought to be like—and Jesus more than once
tells His disciples that there is nothing on earth to which they
can be compared—we can only say that they are two in number,
and that it is the two “vestures of light” sent to Jesus on the
Mount of Olives, or, in other words, His two natures, which
give Him the means of ascending to the heavens of the Ineffable
One and of the First Mystery respectively. If the author ever
intended to discuss them further, he has certainly not done
so in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> properly so called<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c008'><sup>[494]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the worlds and powers existing “below
the veil,” or within the comprehension of the senses, and symbolized
by the third and inferior “vesture” sent to Jesus,
are indicated even in the address given above with fair
particularity. Their names and relative positions are not easy
to identify; but, thanks to some hints given in other parts
of the book, the universe below “the veil” may be reconstructed
thus<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c008'><sup>[495]</sup></a>:—Its upper part contains the Treasure-house
of light where, as its name implies, the light as it is redeemed
from matter is stored up. There are below it five other worlds
called the Parastatae or Helpers, in one of which Jesus is to
reign during the millennium, and the ruler of the last of which
arranges the pure spirits who dwell below it<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c008'><sup>[496]</sup></a>. The highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>spirit in the Treasure-house is called the First Precept or the
Recorder, and with him is associated the Great Light, who is
said to be the “legate” of the Ineffable One<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c008'><sup>[497]</sup></a>. In the Treasure-house
there are also the orders of spirits set out in the address
just quoted, the only two to which it is necessary to refer
here being the Five Trees<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c008'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and the Twelve Saviours. From
the Five Trees emanated the great “Powers of the Right
Hand” to be next mentioned; while, as is before described,
the Twelve Saviours furnished the spotless souls required for
the Twelve Apostles<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c008'><sup>[499]</sup></a>. The lower part of the same universe
is called the Kerasmos or Confusion, because here the light,
which in the upper part is pure, is mingled with matter. It
is divided in the first instance into three parts, the Right-hand,
the Middle, and the Left-hand<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c008'><sup>[500]</sup></a>. Of these, the Right-hand
contains the spirits who emanated from the Five Trees of the
Treasure-house. At their head is Jeû, who has supreme
authority over all the Confusion<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c008'><sup>[501]</sup></a>. He is called the Overseer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of the Light, and in his name we may possibly recognize a
corruption of the Hebrew Yahweh. With him and of similar
origin is Melchisedek,<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c008'><sup>[502]</sup></a> the Inheritor, Receiver or Purifier of the
Light, whose office it is to take the portions of light as they are
redeemed into the Treasure-house<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c008'><sup>[503]</sup></a>. Another emanation from
the Five Trees is an otherwise unnamed Guard of the Veil of
the Treasure-house<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c008'><sup>[504]</sup></a> which seems to be the veil dividing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Treasure-house from the Place of the Right-hand, and there
are two others of equal rank who are called simply the two
Prohegumeni or Forerunners<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c008'><sup>[505]</sup></a>. Below these again is the
Great Sabaoth the Good, who supplied, as we have seen, the
soul which was in Jesus at His birth, and who is himself the
emanation, not of any of the Five Trees, but of Jeû<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c008'><sup>[506]</sup></a>. He
seems to have a substitute or messenger called the little Sabaoth
the Good, who communicates directly with the powers of
matter. In the Middle come the powers who are set over
the reincarnation of souls and the consequent redemption of
mankind. Of these, the only two named are “the Great Iao
the Good<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c008'><sup>[507]</sup></a>,” spoken of in one passage as the Great Hegumen
(or Leader) of the Middle<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c008'><sup>[508]</sup></a>. He, too, has a minister called
“the Little Iao” who supplies the “power” which, with the
soul of Elijah, animated the body of John the Baptist<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c008'><sup>[509]</sup></a>. He
also has twelve deacons or ministers under him<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c008'><sup>[510]</sup></a>. The other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>great Leader of the Middle is the Virgin of Light<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c008'><sup>[511]</sup></a>. She it is
who chooses the bodies into which the souls of men shall be
put at conception, in discharge of which duty she sends the
soul of Elijah into the body of John the Baptist, her colleague
Iao’s share in the work being apparently limited to providing
the “power” accompanying it. She has among her assistants
seven other virgins of light<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c008'><sup>[512]</sup></a>, after whose likeness Mary the
Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are said to have been
made, and we also read of “receivers” who are under her
orders<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c008'><sup>[513]</sup></a>. The light of the Sun “in its true shape” is said to
be in her place<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c008'><sup>[514]</sup></a>, and there is some reason for thinking that
she is to be considered as the power which directs the material
Sun, while her colleague Iao has the same office as regards
the Moon<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c008'><sup>[515]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to the places of the left, the highest of which
seems to be that which is called the Thirteenth Aeon. This
is a part of the universe the existence of which Jesus conceals
from His disciples until He receives his “vestures,” and there
is much mystery as to its origin. It seems to have been
governed in the first instance by a triad consisting of an unnamed
power referred to as the Great Forefather or the Great
Unseen One, a female power called Barbelo<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c008'><sup>[516]</sup></a>, and a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>male called the Authades or Proud God<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c008'><sup>[517]</sup></a> who plays a principal
part in the episode of Pistis Sophia which forms the ostensible
theme of the book. Of the Great Forefather, we are told
nothing of importance, but what is said of the female power
Barbelo bears out fully the remark which Hippolytus attributes
to Valentinus that among the lesser powers or aeons
the female merely projects the substance, while it is the male
which gives form to it<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c008'><sup>[518]</sup></a>. It is doubtless for this reason that
it is from her that the body of Jesus is said to have come—i.e.
that she provided the matter out of which it was formed
in the first instance, and which had, as He says later in the
present book, to be purged and cleansed by Himself<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c008'><sup>[519]</sup></a>. She
is also spoken of throughout as the origin of all the matter
within the world of sense<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c008'><sup>[520]</sup></a>. This triad, constantly referred
to throughout the book as the Three Tridynami or Triple
Powers, have put forth, before the story opens, twenty-four other
powers arranged in twelve syzygies or pairs who are spoken of as
the Twenty-four Unseen Ones, and who inhabit with them the
Thirteenth Aeon. Only one of these is named and this is the
inferior or female member of the last syzygy. She is named
Pistis Sophia, and gives, as we have seen, her name to the book<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c008'><sup>[521]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now pass from the unseen world, which can nevertheless
be comprehended as being in part at least material, to
the starry world above us which is plainly within the reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of our organs of sense. The controlling part in this is taken
by the powers called the Twelve Aeons, who are ruled before
the advent of Jesus by a power called, like the Supreme Being
in the Ophite system, Adamas<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c008'><sup>[522]</sup></a>. As they are called in one
passage the 12 hours of the day, it may be concluded that
they are the 12 zodiacal signs or, in other words, the Zodiac
or 12 constellations of fixed stars through which the sun appears
to pass in his yearly course<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c008'><sup>[523]</sup></a>. Although nowhere expressly
stated, it may be concluded that they emanated from the last
member of the triad of the Left, <i>i.e.</i> the Authades, who is here
said to have been disobedient in refusing “to give up the purity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of his light,” no doubt when the earth was made, and is accused
of ambition in wishing to rule the Thirteenth Aeon. Through
his creature, Adamas their king, he induces the rulers of the
Twelve Aeons to delay the redemption of the light from matter.
It is from their matter that are made the souls, not only of
men, but of beasts, birds, and reptiles<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c008'><sup>[524]</sup></a>, and if they were allowed
to do as they pleased, the process would go on for ever, as it
is the habit of these Archons “to turn about and devour
their own <i>ejecta</i>, the breath of their mouths, the tears of their
eyes, and the sweat of their bodies,” so that the same matter
is used over and over again<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c008'><sup>[525]</sup></a>. Below the starry world comes
the Sphere of Heimarmene or Destiny, so called apparently
because both the earthly and heavenly lot of each soul is
determined on its downward passage through it, and below
that again the Sphere simply so called, which is the visible
firmament apparently stretched above us. The Archons of
the Aeons, of whom Adamas is the chief, rule their own and
both these lower spheres, and the only hindrance to their
dilatory manoeuvres prior to the advent of Jesus was caused
by Melchizidek the Receiver of the Light<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c008'><sup>[526]</sup></a>, who came among
them at stated times, took away their light, and, after having
purified it, stored it up in the Treasure-house. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>apparently done through the medium of the sun and moon,
who seem to have acted in the matter as the “receivers” of
Melchizidek<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c008'><sup>[527]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can now resume the narrative of the book which has
been interrupted in order that a description of the universe
through which Jesus passes on His ascension might be given.
He tells His disciples that clothing Himself in His third or
least glorious “vesture,” He flew up to the firmament, the
gates of which opened spontaneously to give Him passage<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c008'><sup>[528]</sup></a>.
Entering in, the Archons there were all struck with terror at
the light of His vesture, and wondered how the “Lord of the
Universe<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c008'><sup>[529]</sup></a>” passed through them unnoticed on his descent to
earth<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c008'><sup>[530]</sup></a>. The same scenes are repeated when He enters the
Sphere of Destiny, and again when He reaches the Twelve
Aeons or Zodiac of fixed stars. Before leaving the Twelve
Aeons, Jesus takes away from its rulers a third part of their
power, and alters their course, so that its direction is changed
every six months. This He does, as He tells His disciples,
for a double reason. He thereby prevents the Aeons from
devouring their own matter, and so delaying the redemption
of the light, and He further hinders their movements from
being used by mankind in the divination and magic which
the sinning angels taught when “they came down”—a clear
reference to the story in Genesis of the fall of the angels as
amplified in the <i>Book of Enoch</i>. This alteration, He declares,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>was foreshadowed by the text “I have shortened the times
for my elect’s sake<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c008'><sup>[531]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing upward to the Thirteenth Aeon, Jesus tells His
disciples that he found Pistis Sophia dwelling alone in a place
immediately below it, and He here makes a long digression to
recount her history. She is, as has been said above, one of the
twenty-four invisible but material emanations projected by the
Great Unseen Forefather and his consort Barbelo, and formerly
dwelt with her own partner, whose name is not mentioned, in
the Thirteenth Aeon<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c008'><sup>[532]</sup></a>. But one day happening to look forth
from her place and beholding the light of the Treasure-house,
she longed to ascend towards it and began to sing praises to it.
This angered exceedingly the Authades or Proud God, the Third
Triple Power or chief of the Thirteenth Aeon, who had already,
as has been said, shown his disobedience in refusing to give
up his light. Out of envy and jealousy of Pistis Sophia, he
sends forth from himself a great power with a lion’s face who
is “half flame and half darkness” and bears the name of
Jaldabaoth, which we have met with before among the Ophites<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c008'><sup>[533]</sup></a>.
This Jaldabaoth is sent below into the regions of Chaos, the
unformed and shapeless darkness which is either below or
surrounds the earth<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c008'><sup>[534]</sup></a>, and when Pistis Sophia sees him shining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>there, she mistakes his light for the light of the Treasure-house,
and, leaving her consort, plunges downwards towards
it. She is instantly seized by Jaldabaoth and other wicked
powers sent forth by the Proud God, and grievously tormented
with the object of taking from her her light, so that she may
never again be able to return to her own place. In this plight,
she sings several Metanoiae or hymns of penitence to the light,
and after seven of these, Jesus, as He says, “from pity and
without commandment,” raises her to the uppermost parts of
Chaos where she is slightly more at ease<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c008'><sup>[535]</sup></a>. She continues here
to sing hymns of penitence, but is tormented afresh until,
after her ninth repentance, Jesus receives command from the
First Mystery to succour her. This he does in a battle with
fresh emanations from the Authades, including one in the
shape of “a flying arrow<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c008'><sup>[536]</sup></a>.” Adamas, the king of the wicked
Eons, also sends a power to the assistance of Jaldabaoth, and
the other emanations of the Proud God turn into serpents,
a basilisk with seven heads, and a dragon<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c008'><sup>[537]</sup></a>. The powers of
light sent by Jesus, however, defeat all her enemies, and the
archangels Gabriel and Michael bear her aloft and establish her
in the place below the Thirteenth Aeon, where Jesus finds her
on His ascension as here recorded. But this is not the end.
Jesus tells her that when “three times” are fulfilled<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c008'><sup>[538]</sup></a>, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>will be tormented again. This happens as predicted immediately
before the descent of the “vesture” on Him on
the Mount of Olives. Thereupon, He delivers her for the
last time and restores her to her place in the 13th Aeon, where
she sings to him a final hymn of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c007'>This completes the episode of Pistis Sophia, and the rest
of the book is filled with the questionings upon it of Mary
Magdalene and the other disciples, among whom are prominent
Mary the Mother of Jesus, Salome, Martha, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John the Divine,
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Philip, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Thomas, and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Matthew, to which last-named
three is said to be entrusted the recording of the words of
Jesus, together with <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Peter, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> James and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Andrew. This
has led some commentators to think that the work may possibly
be the <i>Interrogations of Mary</i> (Ἐρωτήσεις Μαρίας), concerning
which Epiphanius says that two versions, a greater and a lesser,
were used by several Gnostic sects<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c008'><sup>[539]</sup></a>. These questionings and
the answers of Jesus are extremely tedious, and include the
comparison of the hymns of Pistis Sophia, fourteen in all, with
certain named Psalms and Odes of David and Solomon of
which they are said to be the “interpretation<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c008'><sup>[540]</sup></a>.” In the
course of this, however, the purpose of the book is disclosed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and appears as the revelation of the glories awaiting the believer
in the world to come, the coming of the Millennium, and
the announcement that Jesus has brought the “mysteries”
to the earth for the salvation of men. But before describing
these, it may be as well to draw attention to the manifest
likeness between the theology and cosmology of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> proper and what has been said above of the tenets of
the Ophites and of Valentinus.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first sight, the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> in this respect seems to be
almost entirely an Ophite book. The Ineffable One, as has
been said, is not to be distinguished from the Ophite Bythos,
while “the First Mystery looking inward and outward” is
a fairly close parallel to the First Man and the Son of Man
of the Ophite system. The names Sabaoth, Iao, and Jaldabaoth
also appear both here and with the Ophites, although
the last-named power now occupies a greatly inferior position
to that assigned to him by them, and from a merely ignorant
power has now become an actively malignant one. The work
assigned to Sophia Without in the older system is here taken
in the Place of the Middle by the Virgin of Light, who is
throughout the working agent in the salvation of mankind;
but it should be noted that she here operates directly and
not through a grosser power as with the Ophites. The idea
of a female divinity ordering the affairs of men for their good
as a mother with her children had already gained possession
of the heathen world in the character of (the Greek) Isis, and
in the hint here given as to the resemblance between her
delegates and the Virgin Mary, we may see, perhaps, the road
by which the Christian world travelled towards that conception
of the Theotokos or Mother of God which played such
an important part in its later creed. Among the powers
inferior to her the names and places are changed, but the
general arrangement remains nearly the same as with the
Ophites, especially the Ophites of the diagram. The starry
world in particular here comes much into evidence, and is given
more important functions than in any other Gnostic system
except the Ophite<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c008'><sup>[541]</sup></a>. The “Gates” of the firmaments are met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>with both here and in the Ophite prayers or “defences”
recorded by Origen<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c008'><sup>[542]</sup></a>, and an allusion put by this last into the
mouth of Celsus and not otherwise explained, to “gates that
open of their own accord,” looks as if Origen’s heathen adversary
may himself have come across the story of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c008'><sup>[543]</sup></a>.
The general hostility of this starry world and its rulers towards
mankind is a leading feature in both systems.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the parallels between the theology of
the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and that of Valentinus are even closer, and
are too important to be merely accidental. The complete
identification of Jesus with the First Mystery strongly recalls
the statement of Valentinus, rather slurred over by the Fathers,
that Jesus was Himself the Joint Fruit or summary of the
perfections of the whole Pleroma or Godhead, and is a much
more Christian conception than that of the earlier Ophites
as to His nature<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c008'><sup>[544]</sup></a>. So, too, the curious theory that each of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the lower worlds has its own “saviour” finds expression in
both systems, as does the idea that Jesus received something
from all the worlds through which He passed on His way to
earth. One may even find a vivid reminiscence of the Valentinian
nomenclature in the name of Pistis Sophia herself,
which combines the names of the feminine members of the
first and last syzygies of the Valentinian Dodecad<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c008'><sup>[545]</sup></a>, Pistis
there being the spouse of Paracletus or the Legate, and Sophia
that of Theletus or the Beloved, while the cause of her fall
in the present book is the same as that assigned in the system
of Valentinus. Hence it may appear that the author of the
<i>Pistis Sophia</i>, whoever he may have been, was well acquainted
with the Ophite and Valentinian theology, and that he continued
it with modifications of his own after the innovating
habit current among the Gnostics and noticed by Tertullian.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cosmology of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, again, the preference
given to Valentinian rather than to the older Ophitic views
is clearly marked. The cause of the descent of the light into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>matter in the first instance is no accident as with the Ophites,
but is part of the large scheme for the evolution or, as the
author calls it, the “emanation” of the universe which was
devised and watched over in its smallest details by the First
Mystery<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c008'><sup>[546]</sup></a>. Whether the author accepted the wild story
attributed to Valentinus by Irenaeus concerning the Fall of
Sophia and her Ectroma, it is impossible to say, because, as
we have seen, he omits all detailed description of the way in
which the two higher worlds which we have called the heavens
of the Ineffable One and the world of the First Mystery came
into being<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c008'><sup>[547]</sup></a>. But it is plain that both must have been made
by or rather through Jesus, because it is stated in the mysterious
five words written on the vesture of Jesus that it is through
the First Mystery that all things exist, and that it was from
him that all the emanations flowed forth<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c008'><sup>[548]</sup></a>. As the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> also says that Jesus is Himself the First Mystery,
this corresponds to the opening words of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s Gospel,
that “by Him all things were made<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c008'><sup>[549]</sup></a>.” Hence the author of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, if confronted with the story of the Ectroma,
would doubtless have replied that this was merely a myth
designed to teach the danger for the uninstructed of acting
on one’s own initiative instead of waiting for the commands
of God, and that in his book he had told the same story in
a slightly different way. This seems to be the only construction
to be placed on the trials of Pistis Sophia herself,
since her desire for light seems not to have been looked upon
as in itself sinful, and the real cause of her downfall was the
mistaking the light of Jaldabaoth for that of the Treasure-house.
But her descent into Chaos, unlike the Fall of her prototype,
apparently had nothing to do with the creation of the universe
and its inhabitants, which in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> seems to
have taken place before the story opens. If they were supposed
by the author to have originated in the passions of Sophia
Without, as Hippolytus tells us Valentinus taught<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c008'><sup>[550]</sup></a>, they
were none the less the direct work of Jesus, and the statement
in Hippolytus, that in the Valentinian teaching Jesus made
out of the supplication of Sophia Without a path of repentance,
finds a sort of echo in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, where it is the
“Metanoiae” or hymns of penitence many times repeated
of Pistis Sophia, her antitype or copy, which bring Jesus to
her succour. A further parallel may be found in Hippolytus’
other statement from Valentinus that Jesus gave this “supplication”
power over the psychic substance which is called the
Demiurge<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c008'><sup>[551]</sup></a>. In the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, the heroine defeats the
Authades with the assistance of Jesus; and there does not
seem much doubt that Pistis Sophia is eventually to receive
her adversary the Authades’ place, an event which is foreshadowed
by the quotation of the text “His bishopric let
another take” in one of her penitential psalms<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c008'><sup>[552]</sup></a>. It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>also appear that Adamas, the wicked king of the Twelve Aeons,
may be the Adversary or Diabolos described by the Valentinians<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c008'><sup>[553]</sup></a>
as the cosmocrator or ruler of this world, his rule
being exercised in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> through his servants, the
Archons of “Heimarmene and the Sphere.” The epithet of
Adamas or ἀδαμαστὸς given in classical literature to Hades
as the Lord of Hell would seem appropriate enough in his
case. This would only leave Beelzebub, prince of the
demons, unaccounted for; but the author does not here give
any detailed description of Chaos which may be supposed to
be his seat. Although the omission was, as we shall see,
amply repaired in other documents put forth by the sect, it
may be here explained by the conviction of the nearness of
the Parusia or Second Advent which marks the <i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c008'><sup>[554]</sup></a>.
On the fulfilment of this hope, the Cosmos was, as we are
informed, to be “caught up,” and all matter to be destroyed<a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c008'><sup>[555]</sup></a>.
What need then to elaborate the description of its most
malignant ministers?</p>

<p class='c007'>The joys of the elect in the world to come, on the contrary,
receive the fullest treatment. In the “completion of the Aeon,
when the number of the assembly of perfect souls is made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>up<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c008'><sup>[556]</sup></a>,” or in other words when all pneumatic or spiritual men
have laid aside their material bodies, they will ascend through
all the firmaments and places of the lesser powers until they
come to the last Parastates, where they are to reign with
Jesus over all the worlds below it<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c008'><sup>[557]</sup></a>. This is the place from
which the power, which the Great Light, the legate of the
Ineffable One, took from the First Precept and passed into
the Kerasmos or Confusion, originated; and it was this world,
or rather its ruler, who arranged Jeû and the other Powers
of the Right Hand in their Places and thus set going the whole
machinery of salvation. Its “light” or glory is said to be
so tremendous that it can be compared to nothing in this
world, and here Jesus will reign with the disciples for 1000
“years of light” which are equal to 365,000 of our years<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c008'><sup>[558]</sup></a>.
Here the thrones of the twelve “disciples” (μαθηταί) will
depend on His<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c008'><sup>[559]</sup></a>, “but Mary Magdalene and John the Virgin
shall be higher than all the disciples<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c008'><sup>[560]</sup></a>.” In the midst of these
beatitudes they will apparently receive further instruction or
further mysteries, the effect of which will be that they will
at the conclusion of the Millennium be united with Jesus in
so close a union that, as it is expressly said, they will become
one with Him, and finally they will become members of the
Godhead and, as it were, “the last limb of the Ineffable One<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c008'><sup>[561]</sup></a>.”
In the meantime they will be at liberty to visit any of the
worlds below them. All those who have received lesser
mysteries,—that is to say, who have received a lesser degree
of instruction and have not become wholly pneumatic or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>spiritual—will after death in this world go to the heaven of
which they have received the mystery, or, in cases where
their instruction has only just begun, be brought before the
Virgin of Light, who will cause their souls to be sent back to
earth in “righteous” bodies, which will of themselves seek after
the mysteries, and, having obtained them, will, if time be
allowed, achieve a more or less perfect salvation. Here,
again, we meet with a close resemblance to the system of
those later Ophites who possessed the diagram described by
Origen; for Jesus tells His disciples that those who have only
taken these lower mysteries will have to exhibit a seal or token
(σύμβολον) and to make an “announcement” (ἀπόφασις)
and a defence (ἀπολογία) in the different regions through
which they pass after death<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c008'><sup>[562]</sup></a>. No such requirements, He
says, will be made from those who have received the higher
mysteries, whose souls on leaving the body will become great
streams of light, which will pass through all the lower places
“during the time that a man can shoot an arrow,” the powers
therein falling back terror-stricken from its light until the
soul arrives at its appointed place. As, therefore, these seals and
announcements and defences will be of no use to the disciples,
the Jesus of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> declares that He will not describe
them in detail, they having been already set out in “the two
great Books of Jeû<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c008'><sup>[563]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What now are these “mysteries” which have so tremendous
an effect on their recipient as actually to unite him with the
Deity after death? The Greek word μυστήριον, which is that
used in the Coptic <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>, does not seem to mean etymologically
more than <i>a secret</i>, in which sense it was applied to the ceremonies
or secret dramas exhibited, as has been said, at Eleusis
and elsewhere, and later, to the Christian Eucharist<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c008'><sup>[564]</sup></a>. In the
early part of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> it is the word used to denote
the First Mystery or first and greatest emanation of God,
who is withdrawn from human contemplation and, as it were,
concealed behind a veil impenetrable by the senses of man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>But in the part of the book with which we are now dealing
it seems to refer not to hidden persons, but to secret things.
These things seem to fall into two categories, one of which
is spoken of as the Mystery of the Ineffable One, and the other
as the Mysteries of the First Mystery. The Mystery of the
Ineffable One is said to be one, but, with the provoking
arithmetic peculiar to the book, it is immediately added that
it “makes” three mysteries and also another five, while it
is still one<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c008'><sup>[565]</sup></a>. The Mysteries of the First Mystery on the other
hand are said to be twelve in number, and these figures may
possibly cover some allusion to the Ogdoad and the Dodecad
of Valentinus<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c008'><sup>[566]</sup></a>. It is also fairly clear that each of these Twelve
Mysteries of the First Mystery must be some kind of ceremony,
and a ceremony which can be performed without much preparation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>or many participants. This we may deduce from
the following description of the merits of one of them:</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the second mystery of the First Mystery, if it is duly accomplished
in all its forms, and the man who accomplishes it shall speak
the mystery over the head of a man on the point of going forth from
the body, so that he throws it into his two ears:—even when the
man who is going forth from the body shall have received it aforetime,
and is a partaker of the word of Truth<a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c008'><sup>[567]</sup></a>,—verily, I say unto you
that when that man shall go forth from the body of matter, his
soul will make a great flash of light, and will pass through every
Place until it come into the kingdom of that mystery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But and if that man has not [aforetime] received that mystery,
and is not a partaker of the word of Truth,—verily I say unto you
that man when he shall go forth from the body shall not be judged
in any Place whatever, nor shall he be tormented in any Place
whatever, and no fire shall touch him on account of that great
mystery of the Ineffable One which is in him; and all shall make
haste to pass him from one hand to the other, and to guide him
into every Place and every order, until they shall lead him before
the Virgin of Light, all the Places being filled with fear before the
sign of the mystery of the kingdom of that Ineffable One which
shall be with him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the Virgin of Light shall wonder and she shall try him,
but he will not be led towards the light until he shall have accomplished
all the service of the light of that mystery, that is to say,
the purifications of the renunciation of the world and all the matter
that is therein<a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c008'><sup>[568]</sup></a>. But the Virgin of Light shall seal that soul with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the excellent seal which is this XXXX<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c008'><sup>[569]</sup></a>, and she shall have it cast in
the same month in which it went forth from the body of matter
into a righteous body which will find the God of Truth and the
excellent mysteries in order that it may receive them by inheritance
and also the light for eternity. Which is the gift of the second
mystery of the First Mystery of that Ineffable One<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c008'><sup>[570]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The only ceremony to which such grace as is here set forth
was likely to be attributed by any Christian in the early age
of the Church was that of Baptism. It was called by writers
like Gregory of Nazianza and Chrysostom a μυστήριον<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c008'><sup>[571]</sup></a>;
while we hear as early as <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul’s time of “those who are
baptized over [or on behalf of] the dead” (βαπτιξόμενοι ὑπὲρ
τῶν νεκρῶν)<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c008'><sup>[572]</sup></a>, the theory being, according to Döllinger, that
those who had wished during their lives to receive baptism
but had not done so, could thus obtain the benefit of the
prayers of the Church, which could not be offered for an unbaptized
person<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c008'><sup>[573]</sup></a>. So much was this the case with some sects,
that it was an offence charged by writers like Tertullian against
the Valentinians that they were in the habit of delaying baptism
as long as possible and even of putting it off till they were
about to die<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c008'><sup>[574]</sup></a>, as in the case in the text. Baptism, too, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>spoken of in sub-Apostolic times as the “seal” (σφραγίς)<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c008'><sup>[575]</sup></a>, or
impress, which may be that which the soul has to exhibit,
both in the Ophite system and in that of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>,
to the rulers of the next world. In any event, the rite was
looked upon by Catholic and heretic alike as an initiation or
commencement of the process by which man was united with
Christ. The other eleven “mysteries of the First Mystery”
are not specifically described in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>; but it is
said that the receiving of any one of them will free its recipient’s
soul from all necessity to show seals or defences to
the lesser powers and will exalt him after his death to the
rank of a king in the kingdom of light, although it will not
make him equal to those who have received the mystery of
the Ineffable One<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c008'><sup>[576]</sup></a>. It therefore seems probable that these
“twelve mysteries of the First Mystery” all refer to the rite
of baptism, and are called twelve instead of one only to accord
with some trifling juggling with words and letters such as was
common with the followers of Valentinus<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c008'><sup>[577]</sup></a>. That baptism was
held in the sub-Apostolic age to be, in the words of Döllinger,
“not a mere sign, pledge, or symbol of grace, but an actual
communication of it wrought by the risen and glorified Christ
on the men He would convert and sanctify, and a bond to
unite the body of the Church with its Head<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c008'><sup>[578]</sup></a>,” will perhaps
be admitted. According to the same author, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul teaches
that “by Baptism man is incorporated with Christ, and puts
on Christ, so that the sacramental washing does away with
all natural distinctions or race;—Greek and Jew, slave and
free, men and women, are one in Christ, members of His body,
children of God and of the seed of Abraham<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c008'><sup>[579]</sup></a>.” He tells us
also that the same Apostle “not only divides man into body
and spirit, but distinguishes in the bodily nature, the gross,
visible, bodily frame, and a hidden, inner, ‘spiritual’ body
not subject to limits of space or cognizable by the senses;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>this last, which shall hereafter be raised, is alone fit for and
capable of organic union with the glorified body of Christ,
of substantial incorporation with it<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c008'><sup>[580]</sup></a>.” If Döllinger in the
<abbr title='nineteenth'><span class='fss'>XIX</span>th</abbr> century could thus interpret <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul’s words, is it extraordinary
that the author of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> should put the
same construction on similar statements some sixteen centuries
earlier? So the late Dr Hatch, writing of baptism in this
connection, says: “The expressions which the more literary
ages have tended to construe metaphorically were taken
literally. It was a real washing away of sins; it was a real
birth into a new life; it was a real adoption into a divine
sonship<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c008'><sup>[581]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If this be so, it seems to follow that the Mystery of the
Ineffable One must be the other and the greatest of the
Christian sacraments. Jesus tells His disciples that it is the
“One and unique word,” and that the soul of one who has
received it “after going forth from the body of matter of the
Archons” will become “a great flood of light” and will fly
into the height, no power being able to restrain it, nor even
to know whither it goes. He continues:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It shall pass through all the Places of the Archons and all the
Places of the emanations of light, nor shall it make any announcement
nor defence nor give in any symbol; for no Power of the
Archons nor of the emanations of light can draw nigh to that soul.
But all the Places of the Archons and of the emanations of light
shall sing praises, being filled with fear at the flood of light which
clothes that soul, until it shall have passed through them all, and
have come into the Place of the inheritance of the mystery which
it has received, which is the mystery of the sole Ineffable One, and
shall have become united with his members<a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c008'><sup>[582]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He goes on to explain that the recipient of this mystery shall
be higher than angels, archangels, and than even all the Powers
of the Treasure-house of Light and those which are below it:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“He is a man in the Cosmos; but he is a king in the light. He
is a man in the Cosmos, but he is not of the Cosmos, and verily
I say unto you, that man is myself and I am that man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, in the dissolution of the Cosmos, when the universe shall
be caught up, and when the number of perfect souls shall be caught
up, and when I am become king in the middle of the last Parastates,
and when I am king over all the emanations of light, and over the
Seven Amen, and the Five Trees, and the Three Amen, and the
Nine Guards, and over the Boy of a Boy, that is to say the Twin
Saviours, and when I am king over the Twelve Saviours and all
the numbers of perfect souls who have received the mystery of light,
then all the men who have received the mystery of that Ineffable
One shall be kings with me, and shall sit on my right hand and
on my left in my kingdom. Verily I say unto you, Those men are
I and I am those men. Wherefore I said unto you aforetime:
You shall sit upon thrones on my right hand and on my left in my
kingdom and shall reign with me. Wherefore I have not spared
myself, nor have I been ashamed to call you my brethren and my
companions, seeing that you will be fellow-kings with me in my
kingdom. These things, therefore, I said unto you, knowing that
I should give unto you the mystery of that Ineffable One, and that
mystery is I and I am that mystery<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c008'><sup>[583]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That this is the supreme revelation up to which the author
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> has been leading all through the book,
there can hardly be any doubt. Its position shortly before
the close of the book<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c008'><sup>[584]</sup></a>, the rhapsodic and almost rhythmical
phrases with which the approach to it is obscured rather than
guarded, and the way in which directly the revelation is made,
the author falls off into merely pastoral matters relating to
the lesser mysteries, all show that the author has here reached
his climax. But does this revelation mean anything else than
that Jesus is Himself the victim which is to be received in the
Sacrament or μυστήριον of the Altar? That the Christians of
the first centuries really thought that in the Eucharist they
united themselves to Christ by receiving His Body and Blood
there can be no question, and the dogma can have come as
no novelty to those who, like the Ophites, had combined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Christianity the ideas which we have seen current among the
Orphics as to the sacramental efficacy of the homophagous
feast and the eating of the quivering flesh of the sacrifice
which represented Dionysos. Döllinger gives the views of
the primitive Church concisely when he says it is “because
we all eat of one Eucharistic bread, and so receive the Lord’s
body, that we all become one body, or as <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul says, we
become members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.”
“We are nourished by communion,” he continues, “with
the substance of His flesh and blood, and so bound to the
unity of His body, the Church; and thus what was begun in
Baptism is continued and perfected in the Eucharist<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c008'><sup>[585]</sup></a>.” Thus,
Justin Martyr, who lived in the reign of Antoninus Pius, says
“the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and
from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished,
is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c008'><sup>[586]</sup></a>.”
That the same idea was realized by the heretics may be gathered
from what has been said above as to the wonder-working
celebration of the Eucharist by Marcus, when the wine was
made to change visibly into blood before the eyes of the
recipient<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c008'><sup>[587]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain also that the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> does not look upon
this perfect union as within the reach of all. Basilides, the first
of the Egyptian Gnostics, had said that not one in a thousand
or two in ten thousand were fit to be admitted to the higher
mysteries, and the same phrase is repeated by Jesus Himself in
one of the later documents of the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> of which the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>
forms part<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c008'><sup>[588]</sup></a>. Those who were worthy of admission to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>mysteries of the Ineffable One and of the First Mystery were
the pneumatics or spiritual men predestined to them from
before their birth. For the others, the psychic or animal
men, there were the mysteries “of the light,” which are, so
to speak, the first step on the ladder of salvation<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c008'><sup>[589]</sup></a>. These
are nowhere described in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> or first document
of the book, the hearer being therein always referred for their
details to the two great Books of Jeû mentioned above, “which
Enoch wrote when I (<i>i.e.</i> Jesus) spoke with him from the tree
of knowledge and from the tree of life, which were in the Paradise
of Adam<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c008'><sup>[590]</sup></a>.” It is here expressly said that Jesus’ own
disciples have no need of them; but their effect is described
as purifying the body of matter, and transforming their
recipient into “light” of exceeding purity. On the death
of one who has taken them all, his soul traverses the different
heavens repeating the passwords, giving in the defences, and
exhibiting the symbols peculiar to each mystery until it reaches
the abode assigned to its particular degree of spiritual illumination.
These mysteries of the light are open to the whole world
and there is some reason for thinking they are the sacraments
of the Catholic Church, the members of which body, Irenaeus
says, the “heretics” (<abbr class='spell'>Qy</abbr> the Valentinians?) held not to be saved
but to be only capable of salvation<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c008'><sup>[591]</sup></a>. If the recipient of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>lesser mysteries dies before complete initiation, he has to undergo
a long and painful series of reincarnations, his soul being sent
back into the Sphere of Destiny and eventually into this world
by the Virgin of Light, who will, however, take care that it
is placed in a “righteous” body which shall strive after the
mysteries until it finds them. But the way to these lower
mysteries is the complete renunciation of this world. Man
naturally and normally is entirely hylic or material, being,
as Jesus tells His disciples in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, “the very dregs
of the Treasure-house, of the Places of those on the Right
Hand, in the Middle, and on the Left Hand, and the dregs of
the Unseen Ones and of the Archons, and, in a word, the dregs
of them all<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c008'><sup>[592]</sup></a>.” Hence it is only by the cleansing grace of the
mysteries that he can hope to escape the fate which is coming
upon the Kerasmos, and to obtain these, he must avoid further
pollution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wherefore preach you to the whole race of men, saying: Slacken
not day and night until ye find the cleansing mysteries. Say unto
them: Renounce the world and all the matter that is therein;
for whoso buys and sells in the world and eats and drinks in its
matter, and lives in all its cares and all its conversations, takes
unto himself other matter as well as his own matter.... Wherefore
I said unto you aforetime: Renounce the whole world and all
the matter that is therein lest ye add other matter to your own
matter. Wherefore preach ye to the whole race of men ... cease
not to seek day and night and stay not your hand until ye find
the cleansing mysteries which will cleanse you so as to make you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>pure light, that ye may go into the heights and inherit the light
of my kingdom<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c008'><sup>[593]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We see, then, that the author of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> really
contemplated the formation of a Church within a Church, where
a group of persons claiming for themselves special illumination
should rule over the great body of the faithful, these last being
voluntarily set apart from all communion with their fellows<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c008'><sup>[594]</sup></a>.
This was so close a parallel to what actually occurred in Egypt
in the <abbr title='fourth'><span class='fss'>IV</span>th</abbr> century, when the whole male population was
said with some exaggeration to have embraced the monastic
life<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c008'><sup>[595]</sup></a>, and submitted themselves to the rule of an ambitious
and grasping episcopate, as to give us a valuable indication
as to the authorship and date of the book. It may be said
at the outset that the conception of the universe which appears
throughout is so thoroughly Egyptian that it must have been
written for Egyptian readers, who alone could have been
expected to understand it without instruction. The idea
of the Supreme Being as an unfathomable abyss was, as has
been said in Chapter <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>, a very old one in Egypt, where one of
the oldest cosmogonies current made Nu or the sea of waters
the origin of both gods and men<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c008'><sup>[596]</sup></a>. So was the peculiar theory
that the lesser gods were the limbs or members of the Supreme<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c008'><sup>[597]</sup></a>.
An Ogdoad<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c008'><sup>[598]</sup></a> or assembly of eight gods arranged in syzygies or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>couples was also well known in the time of the early dynasties,
as was the Dodecad of twelve gods which Herodotus knew, and
which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Maspero refers on good evidence to the time of the
Pyramid-Builders<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c008'><sup>[599]</sup></a>. So was the view that men and other
material things were made from the tears of the celestial
powers<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c008'><sup>[600]</sup></a>, a notion well known to Proclus the Neo-Platonist,
who attributed it to the legendary Orpheus<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c008'><sup>[601]</sup></a>. Not less Egyptian—perhaps
in its origin exclusively Egyptian—is the view that the
knowledge of the places of the world after death and their rulers
was indispensable to the happiness of the dead. “Whosoever,”
says <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Maspero in commenting upon some funerary texts of
the Ramesside period, “knows the names of these (gods) while
still on earth and is acquainted with their places in Amenti,
will arrive at his own place in the other world and will be in
all the places reserved for those who are justified<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c008'><sup>[602]</sup></a>.” The
resemblance between the system of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and the
doctrines of the Egyptian religion in the days of the Pharaohs
has been pointed out in detail by the veteran Egyptologist
the late Prof. Lieblein and has been approved by <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Maspero<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c008'><sup>[603]</sup></a>.
It extends to particular details as well as to general ideas,
as we see from the ritual inscribed on the tombs at Thebes,
where each “circle” or division of the next world is said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>have its own song and its own “mystery,” an idea often met
with in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c008'><sup>[604]</sup></a>. Even the doctrine in the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> that the dead had to exhibit a “seal” as well as a
“defence” to the guardians of the heavenly places is explained
by the Egyptian theory that no spell was effective without
an amulet, which acted as a kind of material support to it<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c008'><sup>[605]</sup></a>.
The greater part of the allusions in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> are in
fact unintelligible, save to those with some acquaintance
with the religious beliefs of the Pharaonic Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time it is evident that the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> that has come down to us is not the original form of the
book. All the scholars who have studied it are agreed that the
Coptic version has been made from a Greek original by a scribe
who had no very profound acquaintance with the first-named
tongue<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c008'><sup>[606]</sup></a>. This appears not only from the frequent appearance
in it of Greek words following Coptic ones of as nearly as possible
the same meaning; but from the fact that the scribe here and
there gives us others declined according to the rules not of
Coptic but of Greek accidence. We must therefore look for
an author who, though an Egyptian and acquainted with the
native Egyptian religion, would naturally have written in
Greek; and on the whole there is no one who fulfils these
requirements so well as Valentinus himself. The fact that
the author never quotes from the Gospel according to <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John
indicates that it had not come to his knowledge; for the opening
chapter of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s Gospel contains many expressions that
could easily on the Gnostic system of interpretation be made
to accord with the Valentinian theology, and is in fact so used
by later writers of the same school as the author of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i><a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c008'><sup>[607]</sup></a>. Now the first direct and acknowledged quotation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>from <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s Gospel that we have is that made by Theophilus,
who was made bishop of Antioch in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 170, and the generally
received opinion is that this Gospel, whenever written, was
not widely known long before this date<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c008'><sup>[608]</sup></a>. The only founders
of Gnostic sects of Egyptian birth prior to this were Basilides
and Valentinus, and of these two, Valentinus is the more likely
author, because he, unlike his predecessor, evidently taught
for general edification, and possessed, as the Fathers agree,
a numerically large following. We have, moreover, some
reason for thinking that Valentinus actually did write a book
with some such title as the <i>Sophia</i>. Tertullian, in his declamation
against the Valentinians, quotes a sentence from “the
Wisdom (Lat. Sophia) not of Valentinus but of Solomon<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c008'><sup>[609]</sup></a>.” It
has been suggested that he is here referring to some saying of
the Valentinian aeon Sophia; but no writings would in the
nature of things be attributed to her, and, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau
points out, it is more natural to think that he was here comparing
a book with a book<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c008'><sup>[610]</sup></a>. This figure of rhetoric was a
favourite one with Tertullian, for in his treatise <span lang="la"><i>De Carne
Christi</i></span> we find him quoting in like manner the Psalms—“not
the Psalms of Valentinus, the apostate, heretic, and
Platonist, but the Psalms of David<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c008'><sup>[611]</sup></a>.” The fact that the
story in the British Museum <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> is called <i>Pistis Sophia</i> instead
of <i>Sophia</i> only need not hinder us from identifying this
with the work presumably referred to by Tertullian, because
this title is, as has been said, the work of another scribe
than those who transcribed the original; and Pistis Sophia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>is sometimes spoken of in the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> itself as Sophia only<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c008'><sup>[612]</sup></a>. Moreover,
there is some reason for thinking that certain of the
Fathers and even their Pagan adversaries had seen and read
the story of <i>Pistis Sophia</i>. The allusion quoted above from
Origen to gates opening of their own accord seems to refer to
one of its episodes, and Tertullian, in the treatise in which
he says he is exposing the original tenets of the sect<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c008'><sup>[613]</sup></a>, uses
many expressions that he can hardly have borrowed from any
other source. Thus, he speaks of Sophia “breaking away
from her spouse<a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c008'><sup>[614]</sup></a>” which is the expression used by Pistis
Sophia in her first Metanoia and is in no way applicable to the
Valentinian Sophia of Irenaeus or Hippolytus. He again speaks
of the same Sophia as being all but swallowed up and dissolved
in “the substance” evidently of Chaos, which is the fate which
Pistis Sophia anticipates for herself in the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> Tertullian,
like the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, also assigns to the psychic substance
the place of honour or right hand in the <i>quasi</i>-material world,
while the hylic is relegated in both to the left hand<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c008'><sup>[615]</sup></a>. The
Paradise of Adam is said by him to be fixed by Valentinus
“above the third heaven<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c008'><sup>[616]</sup></a>” as it is in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, if,
as we may suppose, the soul of the protoplast dwelt in the
same place as that of Elijah. The name of <i>Ecclesia</i> or the
Church is given not only to a particular aeon in the Pleroma,
but also to the divine power breathed into man from a higher
world in both Tertullian and the <i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c008'><sup>[617]</sup></a>, and, in the
treatise <span lang="la"><i>De Carne Christi</i></span>, Tertullian alludes contemptuously
to an heretical doctrine that Christ possessed “any new kind
of flesh miraculously obtained from the stars<a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c008'><sup>[618]</sup></a>,” which seems
to refer to the taking by Jesus in the opening of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> of a body from “Barbelo” the goddess or Triple Power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>set over matter and inspiring the benefic planet Venus. For
all which reasons it seems probable that in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>
we have the translation of an authentic work by Valentinus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, however, is not the only work in the
British Museum <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> The first and second books of it, as
they are called by the annotator, come to an end, rather abrupt
but evidently intentional, on the <abbr title='two hundred and fifty-second'>252nd</abbr> page of the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> There
then appears the heading in the hand of the annotator “Part
of the Texts of the Saviour<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c008'><sup>[619]</sup></a>,” and on this follow two pages
dealing with the “members” of the Ineffable One, as to which
it is expressly said that only a partial revelation is made<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c008'><sup>[620]</sup></a>.
These seem to have slipped out of their proper place, and are
followed by two discontinuous extracts from another treatise,
the second of which is also headed by the annotator “Part
of the Texts of the Saviour.” This second part, which we
shall venture to take before the other, is evidently the introduction
to or the commencement of a new treatise, for it
begins with the statement that “After they had crucified Our
Lord Jesus He rose from the dead on the third day,” and
that His disciples gathered round Him, reminding Him that
they had left all to follow Him<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c008'><sup>[621]</sup></a>. Jesus “standing on the
shore of the sea Ocean,” then makes invocation to the “Father
of every Fatherhood, boundless light,” in a prayer composed
of Egyptian and Hebrew words jumbled together after the
fashion of the spells in the Magic Papyri<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c008'><sup>[622]</sup></a>. He then shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the disciples the “disk of the sun” as a great dragon with
his tail in his mouth drawn by four white horses and the disk
of the moon like a ship drawn by two white steers<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c008'><sup>[623]</sup></a>. The two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>steering oars of this last are depicted as a male and a female
dragon who take away the light from the rulers of the stars among
whom they move. Jesus and His disciples are then translated
to the place called the “Middle Way<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c008'><sup>[624]</sup></a>.” He there describes
how the Archons of Adamas rebelled and persisted in engendering
and bringing forth “rulers and archangels and angels and
ministers and decans.” We further hear, for the first time,
that the Twelve Aeons, instead of being, as in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>,
all under the rule of Adamas, are divided into two classes,
one Jabraoth ruling over six of them and Sabaoth Adamas
over the other six; that Jabraoth and his subjects repented
and practised “the mysteries of the light,” including, as we
have seen, abstinence from generation<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c008'><sup>[625]</sup></a>, whereupon they were
taken up by Jeû to the light of the sun between the “places
of the middle and those of the left.” “Sabaoth Adamas,”
on the other hand, with his subjects to the number of 1800,
were bound to the sphere, 360 powers being set over them,
the 360 being controlled by the five planets Saturn, Mars,
Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter. Jesus then describes in great
detail the different tortures in the Middle Way and two other
hells called Chaos and Amenti, wherein the souls of uninitiated
men who commit sins are tormented between their
incarnations<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c008'><sup>[626]</sup></a>, the final punishment being in the worst cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>annihilation. He then affords His disciples a vision of “fire
and water and wine and blood” which He declares He brought
with Him on His Incarnation, and celebrates a sacrament
which He calls “the baptism of the First Oblation,” but which
seems to be a peculiar form of the Eucharist with invocations
in the jargon alluded to above, and a thaumaturgic conversion
of the wine used in it into water and <i>vice versâ</i><a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c008'><sup>[627]</sup></a>. There are
several <i>lacunae</i> in this part of the <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>, and the tortures for
certain specified sins are differently given in different places, so
that it is probable that with the <i>Part of the Texts of the Saviour</i>
has here been mixed extracts from another document whose
title has been lost<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c008'><sup>[628]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining document of the British Museum <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>,
being the third in order of place, was probably taken from
the same book as that last described, and was placed out of
its natural order to satisfy the pedantry of the scribes, the
rule in such cases being that the longer document should always
come first. Like its successor, it deals largely with the “punishments”
of the souls who have not received the mysteries of
the light, and introduces a new and still more terrible hell
in the shape of the “Dragon of Outer Darkness” which it
declares to be a vast dragon surrounding the world, having
his tail in his mouth, and containing twelve chambers, wherein
the souls of the uninitiated dead are tortured after their transmigrations
are ended until they reach the annihilation reserved
for them at the last judgment<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c008'><sup>[629]</sup></a>. There is also given here a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>very curious account of man’s invisible part, which is said
to be made up of the “Power” infused into it by the Virgin
of Light which returns to its giver after death<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c008'><sup>[630]</sup></a>, and the Moira
or Fate which it derives from the Sphere of Destiny and has as
its sole function to lead the man it inhabits to the death he is
predestined to die<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c008'><sup>[631]</sup></a>. Then there is the Counterfeit of the Spirit,
which is in effect a duplicate of the soul proper and is made
out of the matter of the wicked Archons. This not only incites
the soul to sin, but follows it about after death, denouncing to
the powers set over the punishments the sins it has induced
the soul to commit<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c008'><sup>[632]</sup></a>. All these punishments, to describe which
is evidently the purpose of all the extracts from the <i>Texts
of the Saviour</i> here given, are escaped by those who have received
the mysteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Texts of the Saviour</i> therefore clearly belong to a later
form of Gnosticism than the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> properly so called.
The author’s intention is evidently to frighten his readers
with the fate reserved for those who do not accept the teaching
of the sect. For this purpose the division of mankind into
pneumatic, psychic, and hylic is ignored<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c008'><sup>[633]</sup></a>, and this is especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>plain in certain passages where the torments after death of
those who follow “the doctrines of error” are set forth. Magic,
which has been spoken of with horror in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, is
here made use of in the celebration of the rites described,
and the miraculous power of healing the sick and raising the
dead, though said to be of archontic, <i>i.e.</i> diabolic, origin is here
recommended as a means to be employed under certain safeguards
for the purpose of converting “the whole world<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c008'><sup>[634]</sup></a>.”
Even the duration of the punishments and the different bodies
into which the souls of the men are to be cast are made to depend
upon the relative positions of the stars and planets which seem
to be interpreted according to the rules of the astrology of
the time,—a so-called science, which is spoken of scornfully
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> itself<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c008'><sup>[635]</sup></a>. Yet it is evident that the author
or authors of the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i> are acquainted with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>book which precedes it; for in a description of the powers
which Jeû, who appears in both as the angelic arranger of
the Kerasmos, “binds” in the five planets set to rule over
it, we learn that he draws a power from “Pistis Sophia, the
daughter of Barbelo” and binds it in the planet Venus or
Aphrodite<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c008'><sup>[636]</sup></a>. As this is the only reference to her, and receives
no further explanation, it is plain that the writer assumed
his readers to be well acquainted with Pistis Sophia’s history,
and Jeû, Melchisidek, Adamas, and Jaldabaoth, now one
of the torturers in Chaos, appear, as we have seen, in both
works. The author of the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i> also shows
himself the avowed opponent of the Pagan deities still worshipped
in the early Christian centuries, as is evidenced by his making
not only the Egyptian Typhon, but Adonis, Persephone, and
Hecate, fiends in hell. Oddly enough, however, he gives an
explanation of the myth of the two springs of memory and
oblivion that we have seen in the Orphic gold plates in the
following passage, which may serve as an example of the
style of the book:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jesus said: When the time set by the Sphere of Destiny<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c008'><sup>[637]</sup></a> for a
man that is a persistent slanderer to go forth from the body is
fulfilled, there come unto him Abiuth and Charmon, the receivers
of Ariel<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c008'><sup>[638]</sup></a>, and lead forth his soul from the body, that they may
take it about with them for three days, showing it the creatures of
the world. Thereafter they drag it into Amenti unto Ariel that
he may torment it in his torments for eleven months and twenty-one
days. Thereafter they lead it into Chaos unto Jaldabaoth and
his forty-nine demons, that each of his demons may set upon it
for eleven months and twenty-one days with whips of smoke.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Thereafter they lead it into rivers of smoke and seas of fire that
they may torment it therein eleven months and twenty-one days.
Thereafter they lead it on high into the Middle Way that each of
the Archons of the Middle Way may torment it with his own torments
another eleven months and twenty-one days. And thereafter they
lead it unto the Virgin of Light who judges the righteous and the
sinners, and she shall judge it. And when the Sphere is turned
round, she delivers it to her receivers that they may cast it forth
among the Aeons of the Sphere. And the servants of the Sphere
lead it into the water which is below the Sphere, that the boiling
steam may eat into it, until it cleanse it thoroughly. Then Jaluha
the receiver of Sabaoth Adamas, bearing the cup of oblivion delivers
it to the soul, that it may drink therein and forget all the
places and the things therein through which it has passed<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c008'><sup>[639]</sup></a>. And
it is placed in an afflicted body wherein it shall spend its appointed
time<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c008'><sup>[640]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The object of the cup of oblivion is obviously that the wicked
man may learn nothing from the torments he has endured. In
the case of the righteous but uninitiated dead, the baleful effect
of this cup will be annulled by “the Little Sabaoth the
Good” who will administer to him another cup “of perception
and understanding and wisdom” which will make the soul
seek after the mysteries of light, on finding which it will inherit
light eternal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be easy to see in these features of the <i>Texts of the
Saviour</i> the work of Marcus the magician who, as was said in
a former chapter, taught, according to the Fathers, a corrupted
form of the doctrine of Valentinus for his own interested purposes<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c008'><sup>[641]</sup></a>.
The distinguishing feature about his celebration of
the Eucharist is the same as that given in the <i>Texts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Saviour</i>, and as Clement of Alexandria was acquainted with
a sect in his day which substituted water for wine therein<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c008'><sup>[642]</sup></a>,
it is probable that Marcosians were to be found during the
latter part of the IInd century in Egypt. It is also to be
noted that the annotator has written upon the blank leaf
which separates the first and second books of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>
a cryptogram concealing, apparently, the names of the Ineffable
One and the other higher powers worshipped by Valentinus,
and this seems to be constructed in much the same way as the
isopsephisms and other word-puzzles attributed by Irenaeus
to Marcus<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c008'><sup>[643]</sup></a>. The mixture of Hebrew names and words with
Egyptian ones in the prayer of Jesus given in the <i>Texts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the Saviour</i> would agree well with what the last-named Father
says about Marcus being a Jew, and a prayer which he represents
Marcus as making over the head of a convert baptized into his
sect is couched in a jargon of the same character<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c008'><sup>[644]</sup></a>. On the
other hand, the opening sentence of the book calls Jesus “our
Lord,” which Irenaeus tells us the Valentinians carefully
abstained from doing<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c008'><sup>[645]</sup></a>, and the long and detailed description of
the different hells and their tortures is much more Egyptian
than Jewish<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c008'><sup>[646]</sup></a>. The remark attributed to Basilides as to one in
a thousand and two in ten thousand being worthy to take the
higher mysteries is here put into the mouth of Jesus, and
perhaps it would be safer to attribute for the present the <i>Texts
of the Saviour</i> not to Marcus himself, but to some later Gnostic
who fused together his teaching with that of the earlier and
more disinterested professors of Egyptian Gnosticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same remarks apply with but little modification to some
other fragments of Gnostic writings which have come down
to us. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford is to be seen a <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>
written on papyrus, which was brought to this country by
the Abyssinian traveller, Bruce. This also is in the Sahidic
dialect of Coptic, and although it has been badly damaged
and the ink is rapidly disappearing in the damp climate of
Oxford, yet a copy taken nearly a century ago by Woide makes
its decipherment possible in most places. The Bruce Papyrus,
like the British Museum parchment <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr>, contains more than
one document. Unfortunately the arrangement of the leaves
is by no means certain, and the two scholars who have studied
it most thoroughly differ almost as widely as possible as to
the order of its contents. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau, a celebrated Egyptologist
and Coptic scholar, who published in 1882 a copy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the text with a French translation in the <span lang="fr"><i>Notices et Extraits</i></span> of the
Académie des Inscriptions, considers that the treatises contained
in it are only two in number, the first being called by the author
in what seems to be its heading The <i>Book of the Knowledge
of the Invisible God</i> and the second <i>The Book of the Great Word
in Every Mystery</i>. Dr Carl Schmidt, of the University of
Berlin, on the other hand, who, like <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau, has studied
the Papyrus at Oxford, thinks that he can distinguish in the
Bruce Papyrus no less than six documents, of which the first
two are according to him the two books of Jeû referred to
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, two others, fragments of Gnostic prayers,
the fifth a fragment on the passage of the soul through the
Archons of the Middle Way, and the sixth, an extract from an
otherwise unknown Gnostic work which he does not venture
to identify further<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c008'><sup>[647]</sup></a>. To enter into the controversy raised
by this diversity of opinion would take one outside the limits
of the present work; but it may be said that at least one, and
that the most important, of the documents in question must
be later than the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>. Not only does this—which
M. Amélineau calls the <i>Book of the Knowledge of the Invisible
God</i> and Dr Schmidt <span lang="de">“Unbekanntes Altgnostisches
Werk”</span>—quote the opening words of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s Gospel: “In
the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God without whom nothing was made<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c008'><sup>[648]</sup></a>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>which, as has been said, the author of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> was unable
to do; but it mentions in briefer form than this last the heavenly
origin of the souls of the Twelve Apostles<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c008'><sup>[649]</sup></a>. There is also in
the same document a description of what appears to be the
“emanation of the universe,” in which the following passage
occurs:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And He [<i>i.e.</i> the Ineffable One] heard them [a prayer by the
lesser powers is referred to]. He sent them powers capable of
discernment, and knowing the arrangement of the hidden Eons.
He sent them according to the arrangement of those who are
hidden<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c008'><sup>[650]</sup></a>. He established their Orders according to the orders of
the Height, and according to the hidden arrangement they began
from below upward in order that the building might unite
them. He created the aëry earth as a place of habitation for
those who had gone forth, in order that they might dwell thereon
until those which were below them should be made strong. Then
he created the true habitation within it<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c008'><sup>[651]</sup></a>, the Place of Repentance
(Metanoia) within it, the Place of Repentance within it, the antitype
of Aerodios<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c008'><sup>[652]</sup></a>. Then [he created] the Place of Repentance within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>it, the antitype of Autogenes (Self-begotten or, perhaps, ‘of his
own kind’). In this Place is purification in the name of Autogenes
who is god over them and powers were set there over the source
of the waters which they make to go forth (?). Here are the names
of the powers who are set over the Water of Life: Michar and
Micheu, and they are purified in the name of Barpharanges<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c008'><sup>[653]</sup></a>.
Within these are the Aeons of Sophia. Within these is the true
Truth. And in this Place is found Pistis Sophia, as also the pre-existent
Jesus the Living, Aerodios, and his Twelve Aeons<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c008'><sup>[654]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>What is intended to be conveyed by this it is difficult to say
in the absence of the context; but the Pistis Sophia mentioned
is evidently the heroine of the book of that name, and the
abrupt mention of her name without explanation shows, as
in the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i>, that the author supposed his readers
to be acquainted with her story. While this part of the Papyrus
may possibly be an attempt by some later writer to fulfil the
promise to tell His disciples at some future time the “emanation
of the universe” frequently made by Jesus in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>,
it cannot be earlier in date than this last-named document.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another large fragment in the Bruce Papyrus is also connected
with that which has been called above the <i>Texts of the
Saviour</i>, and helps to link up this with the system of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> proper. In the first part of the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> the fourth document in the British Museum book), Jesus, as
has been mentioned, celebrates with prodigies a sacrament which
He calls the “Baptism of the first Oblation”; and He tells them
at the same time that there is also a baptism of perfumes,
another baptism of the Holy Spirit of Light, and a Spiritual
Chrism, besides which He promises them “the great mystery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of the Treasure-house of Light and the way to call upon it
so as to arrive thither,” a “baptism of those who belong to
the Right Hand,” and of “those who belong to the Middle”
and other matters. These promises are in some sort fulfilled
in that part of the Bruce Papyrus which Dr Schmidt will have
it is “the Second Book of Jeû<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c008'><sup>[655]</sup></a>,” where Jesus celebrates with
accompanying prodigies three sacraments which He calls the
Baptism of Fire of the Virgin of the Treasure-house of Light, the
Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and a “mystery” which is said to
take away from His disciples “the wickedness of the archons<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c008'><sup>[656]</sup></a>.”
The details of these vary but very slightly from the “Baptism
of the First Oblation” celebrated by Jesus in the <i>Texts of the
Saviour</i>, and seem to have been written in continuation and
as an amplification of it. But the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i>, as
we have seen, also mention Pistis Sophia in such a way as
to presuppose an acquaintance with her history; and the
presumption that the author of the Bruce Papyrus had read
the book bearing her name is confirmed by the repetition in it of
the names of Jeû, here called “the Great Man, King of the great
aeon of light,” the Great Sabaoth the Good, the Great Iao the
Good, Barbelo<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c008'><sup>[657]</sup></a>, the Great Light, and all the “Amens,” “Twin
Saviours,” “Guardians of Veils” and the rest who are classed
together in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> as the great emanations of light,
and mentioned in a connection which shows them to have
the same functions in all these documents<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c008'><sup>[658]</sup></a>. When we add
to these the repetition of the tradition, formally stated for
the first time in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, that Jesus spent twelve
years with His disciples between His Resurrection and His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Ascension<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c008'><sup>[659]</sup></a>, there can be little doubt that this part of the Papyrus
Bruce also is subsequent to the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>. Similar arguments,
which are only omitted here for the sake of greater
clearness, apply to all the rest of Dr Schmidt’s documents,
and it follows that none of the contents of the Papyrus can
be considered as any part of the “Books of Jeû” mentioned
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c008'><sup>[660]</sup></a>, which, therefore, remains the parent
document on which all the others are based. As to their
absolute date, it seems impossible to arrive at any useful
conclusion. Both <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau and Dr Schmidt are agreed
that the Coptic Papyrus is a translation from Greek originals;
and <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Amélineau does not put this too far forward when he
suggests that it was made in the <abbr title='second'><span class='fss'>II</span>nd</abbr> and <abbr title='third'><span class='fss'>III</span>rd</abbr> century of
our era<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c008'><sup>[661]</sup></a>. Dr Schmidt is probably nearer the mark when
he puts the actual transcription of the Papyrus as dating in
the earliest instance from the <span class='fss'>V</span>th century. His earliest date
for any of the Greek originals is the first half of the <abbr title='third'><span class='fss'>III</span>rd</abbr> century<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c008'><sup>[662]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>If now we put these later documents—the <i>Texts of the
Saviour</i> and those contained in the Bruce Papyrus—side by
side, we notice a marked, if gradual, change of tendency from
the comparatively orthodox Christianity of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>
proper. In the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i> notably, the fear of hell
and its punishments is, as we have seen, present throughout,
and seems to be the sanction on which the author relies to
compel his readers to accept his teaching. In the documents
of the Bruce Papyrus this is also to be found in more sporadic
fashion, nearly the whole of the book being occupied by the
means by which men are to escape the punishment of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>sins. These methods of salvation are all of them what we
have earlier called gnostical or magical, and consist simply
in the utterance of “names” given us in some sort of crypto-grammatic
form, and the exhibition of “seals” or rather
impressions (χαρακτῆρες) here portrayed with great attention to
detail, which, however, remain utterly meaningless for us. Thus
to quote again from what Dr Schmidt calls the Second Book
of Jeû, Jesus imparts to His disciples the “mystery” of
the Twelve Aeons in these words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you have gone forth from the body and come into the
First Aeon, the Archons of that Aeon will come before you. Then
stamp upon yourselves this seal <abbr class='spell'>AA</abbr>, the name of which is zôzesê.
Utter this once only. Take in your two hands this number, 1119.
When you have stamped upon yourselves this seal and have
uttered its name once only, speak these defences; ‘Back! Protei
Persomphôn Chous, O Archons of the First Aeon, for I invoke
Êazazêôzazzôzeôz.’ And when the Archons of the First Aeon shall
hear that name, they will be filled with great fear, they will flee
away to the West, to the Left Hand, and you will enter in<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c008'><sup>[663]</sup></a>”:</p>

<p class='c010'>and the same process with different names and seals is to be
repeated with the other eleven aeons. This is, of course, not
religion, such as we have seen in the writings of Valentinus,
nor even the transcendental mysticism of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>,
but magic, and magic of a peculiarly Egyptian form.
The ancient Egyptian had always an intense fear of the
world after death, and from the first conceived a most gloomy
view of it. The worshippers of Seker or Socharis, a god so
ancient that we know him only as a component part of the
triune or syncretic divinity of late dynastic times called Ptah-Seker-Osiris,
depicted it as a subterranean place deprived
of the light of the sun, hot and thirsty, and more dreary than
even the Greek Hades or the Hebrew Sheol.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The West is a land of sleep and darkness heavy, a place where
those who settle in it, slumbering in their forms, never wake to see
their brethren; they never look any more on their father and
their mother, their heart leaves hold of their wives and children.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The living water which earth has for every one there, is foul here
where I am; though it runs for every one who is on earth, foul
is for me the water which is with me. I do not know any spot
where I would like to be, since I reached this valley! Give me
water which runs towards me, saying to me, ‘Let thy jug never
be without water’; bring to me the north wind, on the brink
of water, that it may fan me, that my heart may cool from its pain.
The god whose name is <i>Let Complete Death Come</i>, when he has
summoned anybody to him, they come to him, their hearts disturbed
by the fear of him; for there is nobody dares look up to him from
amongst gods and men, the great are to him as the small and he
spares not [those] who love him, but he tears the nursling from the
mother as he does the old man, and everyone who meets him is
filled with affright<a id='r664'></a><a href='#f664' class='c008'><sup>[664]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The priests took care that such a picture did not fade from
want of reproduction and, true to the genius of their nation,
elaborated it until its main features are almost lost to us under
the mass of details<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c008'><sup>[665]</sup></a>. Especially was this the case with the
religion of the Sun-God Ra, who after his fusion with Amon
of Thebes at the establishment of the New Empire came to
overshadow all the Egyptian cults save that of Osiris. The
tombs of the kings at Thebes are full of pictures of the land
of this Amenti or the West, in which horror is piled upon
horror, and book after book was written that there should be
no mistake about the fate lying in wait for the souls of men<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c008'><sup>[666]</sup></a>.
In these we see the dead wandering from one chamber to
another, breathing a heavy and smoke-laden air<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c008'><sup>[667]</sup></a>, and confronted
at every step by frightful fiends compounded from
the human and bestial forms, whose office is to mutilate, to
burn, and to torture the soul. The means of escape open to
the dead was, under the <abbr title='twentieth'><span class='fss'>XX</span>th</abbr> dynasty, neither the consciousness
of a well-spent life nor the fatherly love of the gods, but
the knowledge of passwords and mysterious names<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c008'><sup>[668]</sup></a>. Every
chamber had a guardian who demanded of the dead his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>name, without repeating which the soul was not allowed
to enter<a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c008'><sup>[669]</sup></a>. Every fiend had to be repelled by a special
exorcism and talisman<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c008'><sup>[670]</sup></a>, and every “circle” through which
the dead passed had its own song and “mystery,” which it
behoved the dead to know<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c008'><sup>[671]</sup></a>. Only thus could he hope to
win through to the Land of Osiris, where he might enjoy a
relative beatitude and be free to go about and visit the
other heavenly places<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c008'><sup>[672]</sup></a>. For this purpose, the map, so to
speak, of the route was engraved on the walls of the tombs of
those who could afford it, and the necessary words to be said
written down. Those who were not so rich or so lucky were
thought to be parcelled out, like the <i>fellahin</i> of that day, or
the <i>villeins</i> of feudal times, in colonies among the different
districts of the lower world, where they flourished or perished
according to the number of talismans or “protections” that
they possessed<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c008'><sup>[673]</sup></a>. “If ever,” says <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Maspero, “there were in
Pharaonic Egypt mysteries and initiates, as there were in
Greece and in Egypt under the Greeks, these books later than
the <i>Book of the Other World</i> and the <i>Book of the Gates</i> are books
of mystery and of initiates<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c008'><sup>[674]</sup></a>.” Thereafter, he goes on to
say, the ancient popular religion disappeared more and more
from Egypt, to give place to the overmastering sense of the
terrors of death<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c008'><sup>[675]</sup></a> and the magical means by which it was sought
to lighten them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to the survival of these ideas that books like the <i>Texts of
the Saviour</i> and those in the Papyrus Bruce must be attributed.
The Gnostic Christianity of Valentinus, direct descendant
as it was of the amalgam of Christianity with pre-Christian
faiths which the Ophites had compounded, no sooner reached
the great mass of the Egyptian people than it found itself
under their influence. In this later Gnostic literature we hear
no more of the Supreme Father of Valentinus, “who alone”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in his words, “is good”; no more weight is laid upon the
Faith, Hope, and Love who were the first three members
of his Heavenly Man; and the Jesus in whom were summed
up all the perfections of the Godhead becomes transformed
into a mere mystagogue or revealer of secret words and things.
All expectation of the immediate arrival of the Parusia or
Second Coming, when the world is to be caught up and all
wickedness to be destroyed, has passed into the background, as
has also the millennium in which the faithful were, in accordance
with a very early belief in Egypt, to share the felicity
of those who had been kings on earth<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c008'><sup>[676]</sup></a>. Instead we have only
appeals to the lowest motives of fear and the selfish desire to
obtain higher privileges than ordinary men. Even the avoidance
of crime has no other sanction, and complete withdrawal
from the world is advocated on merely prudential grounds;
while rejection of the mysteries is the unpardonable sin:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I have gone unto the light” (says the Jesus of the <i>Texts
of the Saviour</i> to His disciples) “preach unto the whole world,
saying: Renounce the whole world and the matter that is therein,
all its cares, its sins, and in a word all its conversation, that ye
may be worthy of the mysteries of the light, that ye may be saved
from all the torments which are in the judgments. Renounce
murmuring, that ye may be worthy of the mysteries of the light,
that ye may escape the judgment of that dog-faced one....
Renounce wrath, that ye may be worthy of the mysteries of the
light, that ye may be saved from the fire of the seas of the dragon-faced
one.... Renounce adultery, that ye may be worthy of
the mysteries of the kingdom of light, that ye may be saved from
the seas of sulphur and pitch of the lion-faced one.... Say unto
them that abandon the doctrines of truth of the First Mystery
‘Woe unto you, for your torment shall be worse than that of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>men, for ye shall dwell in the great ice and frost and hail in the
midst of the Dragon of the Outer Darkness, and ye shall escape no
more from the world from that hour unto evermore, but ye shall
be as stones therein, and in the dissolution of the universe ye shall
be annihilated, so that ye exist no more for ever<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c008'><sup>[677]</sup></a>’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The priests who engraved the horrors of the next world on
the walls of the royal tombs at Thebes would probably have
written no differently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gnosticism then, in Egypt soon relapsed into the magic
from which it was originally derived; and we can no longer
wonder that the Fathers of the Church strove as fiercely against
it as they did. In the age when books like the <i>Texts of the
Saviour</i> and the fragments in the Papyrus Bruce could be
written, the methods of Clement of Alexandria, who treated
Valentinus and his school as Christians bent on the truth
though led into error by a misunderstanding of the purport
of heathen philosophy, were clearly out of place. “Ravening
wolves,” “wild beasts,” “serpents,” and “lying rogues”
are some of the terms the Fathers now bestow upon them<a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c008'><sup>[678]</sup></a>,
and as soon as the conversion of Constantine put the sword
of the civil power into their hands, they used it to such effect
that Gnosticism perished entirely in some places and in others
dragged on a lingering existence under other forms. The
compromise that had served for some time to reconcile the
great mass of the unthinking people to the religion of Christ
thus broke down<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c008'><sup>[679]</sup></a>; and Egypt again showed her power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>resisting and transforming all ideas other than those which
thousands of years had made sacred to her people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the bridge between Paganism and Christianity
which Gnosticism afforded had been crossed by many. As the
Ophites showed the inhabitants of Asia Minor how to combine
the practice of their ancestral worships with the Christian
revelation, so Valentinus and his successors allowed the rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven without the difficulties
attendant on the passage of the camel through the needle’s
eye. The authors of the <i>Texts of the Saviour</i> and the Bruce Papyrus
went further and made it possible for the Egyptian <i>fellah</i>—then
as now hating change, and most tenacious of his own beliefs—to
accept the hope of salvation offered by the new faith while
giving up none of his traditional lore upon the nature of the
next world. In this way, doubtless, many thousands were
converted to Christianity who would otherwise have kept
aloof from it, and thus hastened its triumph over the State.
But the law which seems to compel every religion to borrow
the weapons of its adversaries leads sometimes to strange
results, and this was never more plainly marked than in the
case of Egypt. The history of Egyptian Christianity has
yet to be written; but it seems from the first to have been
distinguished in many important particulars from that which
conquered the West, and it is impossible to attribute these
differences to any other source than Gnosticism. The Pharaonic
Egyptian had always been fanatical, submissive like all Africans
to priestly influence, and easily absorbed in concern for his
own spiritual welfare. Given the passion for defining the
undefinable and the love of useless detail which marked
everything in the old faith, and in systems like those of the
Coptic texts which form the subject of this chapter he had
the religion to his mind. Nor were other and less abstract
considerations wanting. The life of a scribe or temple servant,
as the race began to lose the vigour which at one time had
made them the conquerors of Asia, had come to be looked upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>by the mass of the people as that which was most desirable on
earth<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c008'><sup>[680]</sup></a>; and here was a faith which called upon the Egyptian to
withdraw from the world and devote himself to the care of his
own soul. Hence the appeal of Gnosticism to those who would
escape hell to renounce all earthly cares fell upon good ground,
and Egypt was soon full of ignorant ascetics withdrawn from
the life of labour and spending their days in ecstasy or contemplation
until roused to seditious or turbulent action at
the bidding of their crafty and ambitious leaders. For these
monks and hermits the Hellenistic civilization might as
well not have existed; but they preserved their native superstitions
without much modification, and the practices of magic,
alchemy, and divination were rife among them<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c008'><sup>[681]</sup></a>. So, too,
was the constant desire to enquire into the nature and activities
of the Deity which they had brought with them from their
old faith, and which nearly rent Christianity in twain when
it found expression in the Arian, the Monophysite, and the
Monothelite controversies. In the meantime, the Catholic
Church had profoundly modified her own methods in the
directions which the experience of the Gnostics had shown
to be profitable. The fear of hell came to occupy a larger and
larger part in her exhortations, and apocalypse after apocalypse
was put forth in which its terrors were set out with abundant
detail. Ritual necessarily became of immense importance under
the pressure of converts who believed in the magical efficacy
of prayers and sacraments, in which every word and every
gesture was of mysterious import, and the rites of the Church
were regarded more and more as secrets on which only those
fully instructed might look. The use in them of pictures,
flowers, incense, music, and all the externals of the public
worship of heathen times, which according to Gibbon would
have shocked a Tertullian or a Lactantius could they have
returned to earth<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c008'><sup>[682]</sup></a>, must be attributed in the first instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to the influence of Gnostic converts. Renan is doubtless
right when he says that it was over the bridge between Paganism
and Christianity formed by Gnosticism that many Pagan
practices poured into the Church<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c008'><sup>[683]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from these external matters, on the other hand, the
outbreak of Gnosticism possibly rendered a real service to
Christianity. To the simple chiliastic faith of Apostolic times,
the Gnostics added the elements which transformed it into a
world-religion, fitted to triumph over all the older creeds and
worships; and their stealthy and in part secret opposition forced
the Church to adopt the organization which has enabled her to
survive in unimpaired strength to the present day. Jewish
Christianity, the religion of the few pious and humble souls who
thought they had nothing to do but to wait in prayer and hope
for their Risen Lord, had proved itself unable to conquer the
world, and its adherents under the name of Ebionites were
already looked upon by the Gentile converts as heretics.
Gnosticism, so long as it was unchecked, was a real danger to the
Church, but without it Christendom would probably have broken
up into hundreds of small independent communities, and would
thus have dissipated the strength which she eventually found
in unity. Threatened on the one hand by this danger, and
on the other with the loss of popular favour which the attractions
of Gnosticism made probable, the Church was forced
to organize herself, to define her doctrines, to establish a regular
and watchful hierarchy<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c008'><sup>[684]</sup></a>, and to strictly regulate the tendency
to mystic speculation and arbitrary exegesis which she could
not wholly suppress. Yet these measures could not come
into operation without producing a reaction, the end of which
we have yet to see.</p>

  <h2 id='chap11' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eleven'>XI</abbr> <br> MARCION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We have seen that Valentinus left Alexandria to settle in
Rome before promulgating his new doctrine<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c008'><sup>[685]</sup></a>, and the Eternal
City seems at that time to have drawn to itself as with a magnet
all those Oriental teachers of Christianity who wished to make
innovation in religion. Rome in the <abbr title='second'><span class='fss'>II</span>nd</abbr> century had become
a veritable sink into which poured men of all nations and creeds
whether old or new. Besides the great flood of Isiacists,
Mithraists, and worshippers of the Great Goddess and of the
Syrian Baals, that now began to appear there, Alexander of
Abonoteichos came thither under Marcus Aurelius to celebrate
his newly-invented mysteries<a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c008'><sup>[686]</sup></a>, and succeeded in gaining a foothold
at the Imperial Court. Moreover in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 140, the terrible
war of extermination which Hadrian had been compelled much
against his will to wage against the Jewish nation was at length
over, and the effect of this was to transfer a great number of
Asiatic and African Christians to the world’s metropolis, while
making it more than ever expedient for them to disclaim
connection with the Jews. The slightly contemptuous toleration,
too, which the statesmanlike Hadrian seems to have
extended to the Christians<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c008'><sup>[687]</sup></a>, was not likely to be withdrawn
without reason by his philosophic successor, Antoninus Pius;
and it was doubtless the consciousness of this which led to the
appearance of the various “apologies” for, or defences of,
Christianity which Quadratus, Aristides, Justin Martyr, and
other persons with some philosophic training now began to put
forth. In such of these as have come down to us, the desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of their authors to dissociate themselves from the Jews, then
at the nadir of their unpopularity, is plainly manifest, and no
doubt gave the note to the innovators<a id='r688'></a><a href='#f688' class='c008'><sup>[688]</sup></a>. It is certainly very
marked in the heresy of Marcion, which, unlike those of
Valentinus and the other Gnostics, was to culminate in the
setting-up of a schismatic Church in opposition to that founded
on the Apostles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marcion was, according to the better account, a wealthy
shipowner of Pontus and probably a convert to Christianity<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c008'><sup>[689]</sup></a>.
He seems to have been born at Sinope, at one time the most
important of the Greek towns on the Southern shore of the
Euxine or Black Sea. Mithridates the Great, who was also
born there, had made Sinope his capital, and though it had
no doubt declined in rank since his time, it must still have been,
in the year 100 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> (the probable date of Marcion’s birth), a
flourishing and prosperous place<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c008'><sup>[690]</sup></a>. As in all the cities of Asia
Minor, the Stoic philosophy had there obtained a firm hold,
and there is some reason for thinking that Marcion received
lessons in this before his conversion<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c008'><sup>[691]</sup></a>. Of the circumstances
which led to this event we have no knowledge, and it was even
said in later times that he was born a Christian, and that his
father had been a bishop of the Church. A better founded
story is that, on his conversion, he brought into the common
fund of the Church a considerable sum of money, which is said
to have been paid out to him on his expulsion<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c008'><sup>[692]</sup></a>. When at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>mature age of forty he went to Rome, it seems reasonable to
suppose that he accepted the orthodox teaching, as it is said
that there was some talk of his being made bishop of what was
even then the richest and highest in rank of all the Christian
Churches. At Rome, however, he fell in with one Cerdo, a
Syrian, who seems to have been already domiciled there and to
have taught in secret a pronouncedly dualistic system in which
God and Matter were set in sharp opposition to one another,
and in which it was held that a good God could not have been
the author of this wicked world<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c008'><sup>[693]</sup></a>. This opinion Marcion
adopted and elaborated, with the result that he was expelled
from the Catholic Church, and thereupon set to work to found
another, having bishops, priests, deacons, and other officers in
close imitation of the community he had left<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c008'><sup>[694]</sup></a>. It is said that
before his death he wished to be reconciled to the Church, but
was told that he could only be readmitted when he had restored
to the fold the flock that he had led away from it. This, on
the authority of Tertullian, he would have been willing to do;
but his rival Church had by that time so enormously increased
in numbers, that he died, probably in 165 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, before he was
able to make the restitution required<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c008'><sup>[695]</sup></a>. This story also can
only be accepted with a great deal of reserve<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c008'><sup>[696]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is abundantly plain, however, that Marcion was regarded
not only by the professed heresiologists of the succeeding age,
but also by teachers like Justin Martyr and the learned Clement
of Alexandria, as one of the most formidable enemies of the
Church, whose evil influence persisted even after his death<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c008'><sup>[697]</sup></a>.
By the reign of Gratian, his rival Church had spread over Italy,
Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Syria, and Persia<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c008'><sup>[698]</sup></a>; and, although
the main authority for the increase is the always doubtful one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of Epiphanius, this last was not likely to have unduly magnified
the success of the Church’s rival, and his story has the confirmation
of Tertullian that in his time the Marcionites made churches
“as wasps make nests<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c008'><sup>[699]</sup></a>.” Every Father of note seems to have
written against the heresiarch who had thus dared, as was said,
to turn away souls from Christ, and Polycarp, the saint and
martyr, when Marcion claimed acquaintance with him in Rome
on the strength of a former meeting in Smyrna, replied with
much heat, “Yes, I know thee! the first-born of Satan<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c008'><sup>[700]</sup></a>.”
So late as the Council in Trullo in the <abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr> century, special
arrangements had to be made for the reception of Marcionites
who wished to be reconciled to the Church, and forms of abjuration
of the sect are said to have lingered until the <abbr title='tenth'><span class='fss'>X</span>th</abbr><a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c008'><sup>[701]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>That this longevity was purchased by no willingness to
make the best of both worlds or to enjoy peace by compromising
with heathenism in the way we have seen prevalent among the
Alexandrian Gnostics, is at once evident. Alone among the
heretics of the sub-Apostolic Age, the Fathers declare, the
Marcionites held fast their faith in time of persecution, while
they refused to frequent the circus and the theatre and practised
an austerity of life putting to shame even the ascetics among
the orthodox.<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c008'><sup>[702]</sup></a> Marcion himself underwent none of the slanders
on his personal morals which theologians generally heap upon
their opponents<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c008'><sup>[703]</sup></a>, and none of his tenets are said by either
Tertullian or Epiphanius, who took his refutation most seriously
in hand, to have been borrowed from those Pagan rites or
mysteries which they looked upon as forming the most shameful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>source from which to contaminate the pure doctrine of the
Church. Irenaeus, who was his junior by some twenty or thirty
years, and may have known him personally, says indeed that
he was a disciple of Simon Magus<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c008'><sup>[704]</sup></a>, but in this he may have
alluded merely to his position as the founder of a rival
Church. Hippolytus is silent about this; but, true to his system
of attacking philosophy on account of its supposed connection
with heresy, says that Marcion is a disciple, not of Christ, but
of Empedocles<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c008'><sup>[705]</sup></a>. There is much to be said for the view that
Marcion’s heresy was so well and firmly established before the
end of the <abbr title='second'>IInd</abbr> century, that those who then denounced it
really knew little of its beginnings<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c008'><sup>[706]</sup></a>. They are, however,
unanimous as to the more than Puritanical attitude adopted by
its founders. The Marcionites were allowed neither to drink
wine nor to eat flesh, and those believers in their tenets who
were married had either to separate from their wives or to remain
among the catechumens until about to die, it being unlawful
for them to receive baptism save on their deathbeds<a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c008'><sup>[707]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marcion’s, indeed, seems to have been one of those ruggedly
logical and uncompromising natures, not to be led away by
reverence for authority or tradition, which appear once or
twice in the history of most religions; and it is doubtless this
quality which has led Prof. Harnack, as did Neander in the last
century, to claim him as the first reformer of the Catholic
Church<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c008'><sup>[708]</sup></a>. Like another Luther, Marcion declared that the
Church had become corrupted by the additions made by men
to the pure teaching she had received from her Founder, and
that only in return to her primitive faith was safety to be found.
For this primitive faith, he appealed, like the makers of the
German Reformation, to the words of Scripture, but he differed
from them most widely in the limitations that he placed upon
them. It was, he declared, impossible to find any attributes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in common between the God of the Old Testament and the
Supreme (and benevolent) Being of whom Jesus announced
Himself the Son, and he therefore rejected the Old Testament
entirely. In the same way, he said that the Canonical Gospels
then received among Christians had become overlaid with
Jewish elements introduced by the Asiatic converts among whom
they were first circulated; and that the narrative in the Gospel
according to Luke was alone trustworthy<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c008'><sup>[709]</sup></a>. From this also,
he removed the whole series of traditions concerning the Birth
and Infancy of Jesus; and made it begin in effect with the
words of the fourth chapter in which is described the coming-down
of Jesus to “Capernaum, a city of Galilee.” These he
combined with the opening words of Luke <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr>, so that the event
was described as taking place in the “fifteenth year of the reign
of Tiberius Caesar<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c008'><sup>[710]</sup></a>.” He also excised from the Gospel everything
which could indicate any respect shown by the Founder
of Christianity to the Torah or Law of the Jews, the allusions
to the Jewish traditions concerning Jonah and the Queen of
Sheba, the supposed fulfilment of the Jewish prophecies in the
person and acts of Jesus, and the statement that He took part
in the Paschal Feast. He further removed from it every passage
which represents Jesus as drinking wine or taking part in any
festivity, and in the Lord’s Prayer he struck out the petition
for delivery from evil, while modifying the “Hallowed be thy
name!” It has been suggested that in this last case he may
have given us an older version than that of the Canon<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c008'><sup>[711]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the remainder of the New Testament, Marcion took
similar liberties. He rejected entirely the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>,
The Apocalypse of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John, the <i>Epistle to the Hebrews</i>, and the
Epistles generally called “Pastoral,” as well as all those passing
under the names of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> James, <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Peter and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Jude.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>For the Apostle Paul, however, Marcion had a profound
admiration, pronouncing him to be the only true follower of
Jesus, and he accepted with some alterations the ten epistles
which he thought could with confidence be attributed to him.
These were the Epistles to the Galatians, the two to the Corinthians,
the one to the Romans, both those to the Thessalonians,
that to the Ephesians or, as he preferred to call it, to the
Laodiceans, and those to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to
the Philippians. From these ten epistles, he removed everything
which described the fulfilment of the prophecies of the
Jewish prophets, all allusions to the Parusia or Second Coming,
and some expressions which seemed to him to militate against
the asceticism that he himself favoured<a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c008'><sup>[712]</sup></a>. All these alterations
seem to have been set down by Marcion in a book to which he
gave the name of the <i>Antitheses</i>, and which contained his
statement of the incongruities apparent between the Old and
New Testaments. This book is now lost, and the details of
Marcion’s emendations have in consequence to be picked out
from the treatise of Tertullian against him, the statements of
Epiphanius, and the anonymous discourse <span lang="la"><i>de Recta Fide</i></span> which
is sometimes included in the works of Origen<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c008'><sup>[713]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these alterations of the Scriptures generally received
depended on any independent tradition, or even upon a rational
criticism, they would be of the greatest use to modern textual
critics, who have in consequence hoped eagerly that some lucky
chance might yet give us a copy of Marcion’s Gospel.<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c008'><sup>[714]</sup></a> But
the Fathers make no allusion to any claim of the kind; and in
the absence of Marcion’s own words, it seems likely that his
alterations were merely dictated by the preoccupation regarding
the Divine nature which seems with him to have amounted to
a passion. Never, he said, could the jealous and irascible God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>of the Jews be identified with the loving and benevolent Spirit
whom Jesus called His Father. Hence there was not one God;
but two Gods. One of these was the Supreme Being, perfect
in power as in goodness, whose name, as perhaps the Orphics
and the Ophites taught, was Love<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c008'><sup>[715]</sup></a>. Too great to concern
Himself with sublunary things, and too pure, as Plato and
Philo had both said, to have any dealings with an impure and
sinful world, He remained seated apart in the third or highest
heaven, inaccessible to and unapproachable by man, like the
unknown Father of Valentinus and the other Gnostic sects<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c008'><sup>[716]</sup></a>.
Below Him was the Creator, or rather the Demiurge or Fashioner
of the World, in constant conflict with matter, which he is
always trying unsuccessfully to conquer and subdue in accordance
with his own limited and imperfect ideas. Just, according
to Marcion, was the Demiurge, whom he identified with the
God of the Jews; and it was this attribute of justice which
prevented him from being considered wholly evil in his nature,
as was Satan, the active agent of the matter with which the
Demiurge was always striving. Yet the Demiurge was the
creator of evil on his own showing<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c008'><sup>[717]</sup></a>, and as such is entitled to
no adoration from man, whom he has brought into a world full
of evil. Man’s rescue from this is due to the Supreme God,
who sent His Son Jesus Christ on earth that He might reveal
to mankind His Heavenly Father, and thus put an end to the
sway of the Demiurge.</p>

<p class='c007'>That Jesus on His coming was seized and slain by the Jews,
with at least the connivance of the Demiurge, Marcion admitted.
But as this might seem like a defeat of the Supreme Being by
His inferior, he was forced to accept the theory called Docetism
which was in favour with many other Gnostics. According to
this, the body of Jesus was not real flesh and blood, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>indeed no actual existence, but was a phantasm which only
appeared to mankind in the likeness of a man<a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c008'><sup>[718]</sup></a>. Hence it
mattered nothing that this body, which did not really exist,
appeared to suffer, to be slain, and even to rise again. The
Supreme God was not mocked, and the resurrection of the body
was to Marcion a thing unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In lesser matters, Marcion’s dislike of the God of the Jews
is, perhaps, more marked. Man’s body, according to him, was
made by the Demiurge out of matter<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c008'><sup>[719]</sup></a>, but without any spark
from a higher world infused into it, as the Ophites and Valentinus
had taught. Hence man was naturally inclined to evil, and
the Law which the Demiurge delivered to him was more or less
of a snare. Man was sure to give way to the evil desires inherent
in matter, and on doing so became with all his race subject to
the power of matter and the evil spirits inhabiting it. It is
true that the Demiurge had devised a plan of salvation in the
shape of the Law of the Jews delivered to them on Sinai. But
this concerned one small people only, and it was but a fraction
of that community which could hope to observe it in all its
forms and ceremonies. Did they do so, the Demiurge would
provide for them a modified felicity in that region of Hades
called the Bosom of Abraham<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c008'><sup>[720]</sup></a>. For those Gentiles, and even
for those Jews who from weakness or obstinacy did not obey the
Law, he had prepared punishment and, apparently, eternal
tortures. It is true that he promised the Jews a Messiah who
should lead them to the conquest of the earth, but this leader
certainly was not Jesus<a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c008'><sup>[721]</sup></a>; and it is probable that Marcion
thought that His Mission had put it out of the power of the
Demiurge to fulfil any of these promises.</p>

<p class='c007'>Possibly it was the same dislike of the Jews that led Marcion
to consider <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul as the only real apostle of Jesus. The others,
he said, had overlaid the faith that they had received with
Jewish traditions; but Paul, chosen by Jesus after His
Ascension<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c008'><sup>[722]</sup></a>, had resisted their attempt to reintroduce the Law
of the Jews, and was, in his own words, an apostle sent not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father
who raised Him from the dead.<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c008'><sup>[723]</sup></a> Marcion also seems to have
laid stress upon <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul’s wonder that the Galatians were “so
soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to
another Gospel<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c008'><sup>[724]</sup></a>,” with the suggestion that this second gospel
was the contrivance of the Demiurge; and generally to have
accentuated the controversy between <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Peter and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul
mentioned in the Epistle bearing their name<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c008'><sup>[725]</sup></a>. From the same
Epistle to the Galatians, Marcion appears to have erased the
name of Abraham where his blessing is said to have “come on
the Gentiles through Jesus Christ<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c008'><sup>[726]</sup></a>”; and in like manner, to
have read into the passage in the First Epistle to the Corinthians<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c008'><sup>[727]</sup></a>,
where it is said that “the world by wisdom knew not
God,” expressions implying that it was the “Lord of this
World,” <i>i.e.</i> the Demiurge, who was ignorant of the Supreme
Being<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c008'><sup>[728]</sup></a>. As this ignorance of the Demiurge was a favourite
theme of the Ophites and other Gnostics, it is possible that
Marcion was more indebted to these predecessors of his than
modern commentators on his teaching are inclined to allow;
but he perhaps justified his reading by tacking it on to the
passage in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians which says
that “the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
who is the image of God, should shine upon them<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c008'><sup>[729]</sup></a>.” From the
Epistle to the Romans, in which he seems to have made very
large erasures<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c008'><sup>[730]</sup></a>, Marcion draws further arguments in favour of
his contention that the Jews were kept in ignorance of the
Supreme God, relying upon texts like:</p>

<p class='c009'>“For they [<i>i.e.</i> Israel] being ignorant of God’s righteousness and
going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
themselves unto the righteousness of God<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c008'><sup>[731]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, too, in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians,
Marcion rejects the passage which declares that Jesus shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>come “in flaming fire taking vengeance<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c008'><sup>[732]</sup></a>,” which he considered
inconsistent with the benevolence of Himself and His Father.
We do not know whom he considered to be the Antichrist there
predicted, as Epiphanius leaves us in doubt whether Marcion
accepted the verses which go by the name of the Little
Apocalypse, but Tertullian seems to imply that Marcion may
have assigned this part to the Messiah of the Demiurge<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c008'><sup>[733]</sup></a>. In
like manner, he is said to have altered the passage in the Epistle
to the Ephesians which speaks of “the mystery which from
the beginning of the world hath been hid in God<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c008'><sup>[734]</sup></a>,” so as to
make it appear that the mystery was hid not <i>in</i> God, but <i>from</i>
the god who created all things, meaning thereby the Demiurge<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c008'><sup>[735]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until some lucky discovery gives us the text of Marcion’s
<i>Antitheses</i> it is difficult to say whether he has been correctly
reported by his adversaries, or whether, which is probable
enough, they have suppressed evidence brought forward by
him in support of these erasures and interpolations. That in
putting them forward, he did so in such a way as to leave many
an opening to a skilled controversialist is easy to believe, and
there are many passages in Tertullian’s refutation which show
that his forensically-trained adversary took advantage of these
with more eagerness than generosity. But the noteworthy thing
about the long drawn out dialectic of Tertullian’s treatise
<i>Against Marcion</i>, is the way in which Marcion throughout
resolutely abstains from any of the allegorical or figurative
interpolations of Scripture which we have seen so prevalent
among all the Gnostic writers from Simon Magus down to the
authors of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and its connected texts. Everywhere,
it would seem, he took the Biblical texts that he quotes
at their literal meaning and never seems to have attempted to
translate any of them by trope or figure. In like manner, we
find him, so far as his adversaries’ account goes, entirely free
from that preoccupation concerning the divisions and order of
the spiritual world which plays so large a part in the speculations
of the systems hitherto described. Nor does he show any
tendency to the deification of abstract ideas which is really at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the root of all Gnostic systems whether before or after Christ.
Nowhere does Marcion let fall an expression which could make
us think of the Sophia or Wisdom of God as a separate entity
or personified being, nor is the Logos of Plato and his Alexandrian
admirers ever alluded to by him. Hence, he in no way
contributes to the growth, so luxuriant in his time, of mythology
and allegory<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c008'><sup>[736]</sup></a>. In everything he exhibits the hard and unimaginative
quality of the practical man.</p>

<p class='c007'>These considerations have great bearing on the question of
the source of his heresy. Had he busied himself, like the
Gnostics, with elaborate descriptions of the invisible universe,
one would have thought that he owed something to the ancient
Egyptian theology, in which such speculations occupied nearly
the whole care of its professors. Had he, on the other hand,
studied to personify the attributes and qualities of the Supreme
Being, one would have been able to connect his teaching with
that of the Persian religion, in which, as will be seen in the next
chapter, the idea of such personification took the principal place.
This connection would have been natural enough, because the
province of Pontus, whence Marcion came, had long been
subject to the Persian power, and did not become Roman in
name until the reign of Nero. Yet no trace of such a connection
is even hinted at by adversaries perfectly well informed of the
main tenets of the Persian religion<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c008'><sup>[737]</sup></a>. The inference is therefore
unavoidable that Marcion’s views were original, and that they
were formed, as was said by a critic of the last century, by a
sort of centrifugal process, and after rejecting in turn all heathen
and Jewish elements, as well as most of the traditions which
had already grown up in the Catholic Church<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c008'><sup>[738]</sup></a>. That Marcion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>was aware of this seems probable from the many efforts made
by him to be reconciled to the Church, or rather to convert the
whole Church to his way of thinking. In this, as in the emphasis
which he laid on faith rather than knowledge as the
source of man’s happiness in this world and the next, he again
anticipated in a most striking manner the views of the German
Reformers some fourteen centuries later<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c008'><sup>[739]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A like analogy is to be seen in the practices of the Marcionite
churches, so far at any rate as we may trust to the reports of
their orthodox opponents. True, as it would seem, to his
conviction of the complete failure of the scheme of the Demiurge,
Marcion set his face even more sternly than our own Puritans
of Cromwell’s time against anything that should look like
enjoyment of the things of this world<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c008'><sup>[740]</sup></a>. His followers were
enjoined to eat no meat, to abstain from wine even in the
Eucharist, which in the Marcionite churches was celebrated with
water, and to observe perpetually the strictest continence<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c008'><sup>[741]</sup></a>.
The Sabbath was kept by them as a fast and, although this may
look like an obedience to Jewish custom, Epiphanius, who is our
sole authority for the observance, tells us that Marcion expressly
rejected this attribution<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c008'><sup>[742]</sup></a>. Virginity was, according to him, the
only state of life for the true Christian; and although he
freely baptized unmarried men and eunuchs, he refused baptism
to married persons, as has been said, until they were divorced
or on the point of death<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c008'><sup>[743]</sup></a>. To the enticements of the circus,
the gladiatorial shows, and the theatre, the Marcionites used,
according to Tertullian, to return the answer “God forbid!”;
and they made the same reply, he tells us, when invited to save
their lives in time of persecution by sacrificing a few grains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>incense to the genius of the Emperor<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c008'><sup>[744]</sup></a>. The reason of all this
austerity was apparently their contempt for the kingdom of
the Demiurge and their resolve to do nothing to prolong his rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the spread of the Marcionite heresy we have very little
more information than that given above. Prof. Harnack thinks
150-190 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> was the “golden age of the Marcionites<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c008'><sup>[745]</sup></a>,” but
Tertullian evidently considered that some thirty years after
the last of these dates they were nearly as numerous as the
Valentinians, whom he speaks of as the largest sect of heretics<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c008'><sup>[746]</sup></a>.
An inscription found in a Syrian village refers to a “synagogue”
of Marcionites occupying a site there in 318 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c008'><sup>[747]</sup></a>, which is, as
has been remarked, older than the earliest dated inscription of
the Catholic Church. Theodoret, too, about 440 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, boasts of
having converted more than a thousand of them, a statement
which afterwards swells into eight villages and supposes that
they were pretty thickly clustered together<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c008'><sup>[748]</sup></a>. Yet they must
have led a miserable existence, being persecuted by the Imperial
authorities and their Christian brethren at once, and it is not
to be wondered at that Marcion himself addresses some followers
in a letter quoted by Tertullian as “my partners in hate and
wretchedness<a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c008'><sup>[749]</sup></a>.” It speaks volumes for their faith that they
continued to hold it in spite of everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the more to their credit that they were by no means
at one in matters of belief. In a passage quoted in a former
chapter, Tertullian says that the Marcionites thought it fair to
do what Marcion had done, that is, to innovate on the faith
according to their own pleasure. This is a rhetorical way of
putting it; for the successors of Marcion seem to have differed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>among themselves mainly upon one point, which was, in fact,
the number of “principles” which lay at the beginning of
things<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c008'><sup>[750]</sup></a>. Thanks to his Stoical training, Marcion was forced to
assign a large part in the formation of the cosmos to Matter,
which he nevertheless thought to be essentially evil. But in
that case, how did it come into existence? It surely could not
be the creation of the Supreme and benevolent Being whose
name was Love; and if not, how did it come to exist independently
of Him? To these questions it is possible that the
essentially practical genius of Marcion saw no need to return
any answer, and was content to regard them, like Epicurus
before him, as insoluble problems. But his followers apparently
refused to do so; and hence there arose considerable diversity of
opinion. According to an Armenian author of late date, Marcion
himself taught that there were <i>three</i> principles, that is, the
Supreme God, the Demiurge or Creator, and Matter, which he
regarded as a sort of spouse to the Demiurge<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c008'><sup>[751]</sup></a>. This, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>is extremely unlikely in view of the unanimous assertion of the
Fathers nearer to him in point of time that he taught the
existence of two principles only; and it is probable that the
theory of three principles, if seriously advanced, must have been
the work of one of his followers. Tertullian, whose sophistry in
combating Marcion’s teaching in this respect is here particularly
apparent, points out, indeed, that if the Creator be held to be
self-originated and not himself the creature of the Supreme
God, there must be nine gods instead of two<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c008'><sup>[752]</sup></a>; but there is no
reason to suppose that Marcion ever troubled himself about such
dialectical subtleties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was different with Apelles, who was certainly later
in date than Marcion and perhaps succeeded him in the headship
of the sect, either immediately or at one remove<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c008'><sup>[753]</sup></a>.
According to Tertullian, Apelles left Rome for Alexandria
where he no doubt came in contact with the Gnostic opinions
there rife<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c008'><sup>[754]</sup></a>. The slander that Tertullian sets on foot about him
to the effect that he forsook his master’s continence and was
addicted to the company of women is unexpectedly refuted by
Tertullian’s contemporary, Rhodo<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c008'><sup>[755]</sup></a>. But Apelles must have
come in contact in Alexandria with the followers of Valentinus
and other Gnostic teachers, and their arguments no doubt
compelled him to modify the strict dualism of his master.
According to Rhodo, Apelles asserted that there was only one
principle of all things, which would imply that the Demiurge
was the creature of the Supreme God, and that Matter, instead
of being essentially evil and independent, must have been also
created by Him. Hippolytus, who was possibly a little later than
Rhodo, amplifies this by the statement that Apelles held the
Demiurge to be the fashioner of things coming into being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>(subsequent to him)<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c008'><sup>[756]</sup></a>, and that there was a third god or angel of
a fiery nature who inspired Moses, and even a fourth who was
the cause of evil. In this the Gnostic idea of correspondence
or reflection of one world in another is manifest; but it is evident
that it also approaches more nearly than does the uncompromising
dualism of Marcion himself to the teaching of the Catholic
Church. The same tendency to compromise is evident in
Apelles’ willingness to use the books of both the Old and the
New Testament, quoting with regard to them, if Epiphanius is
to be believed, the apocryphal saying of Jesus “Be ye wise
money-changers!” to be found in, among other works, the
<i>Pistis Sophia</i><a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c008'><sup>[757]</sup></a>. Apelles seems also to have modified his master’s
teaching with regard to the body of Jesus, which was, he said,
no phantasm, but a real body of flesh and blood assumed by
Him on His descent to the earth, and returned by Him piece by
piece on His Ascension to the different elements whence it was
drawn. His indebtedness in this to the sources from which the
author of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> drew the same doctrine needs no
demonstration. Yet there is no reason to assert that Apelles
considered these “corrections” of Marcion’s teaching in any
way essential or binding on his followers. He seems, too, to
have adopted one of the practices of the primitive Church in
paying attention to the ecstatical visions of “prophets” of
both sexes, his faith in the prophecies of a virgin named
Philumene being the foundation of Tertullian’s slander on his
morals. There can be no doubt, however, that in spite of these
tendencies, he remained in essentials a true follower of Marcion,
and that like his master, he deprecated enquiry into insoluble
problems. “One ought not,” he said, as Rhodo reports, “to
examine doctrine, but everyone should be steadfast in the faith.
Those who trust in Him that was crucified will be saved, if
only they do good works<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c008'><sup>[758]</sup></a>.” Herein he also, like Marcion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>himself, seems to have anticipated by many centuries the
teaching of the German Reformers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other followers of Marcion there were who, thanks to our
lack of information concerning them, are to us merely names.
Thus Tatian, who was according to tradition a disciple of Justin
Martyr but fell away from orthodoxy after his teacher’s death,
seems to have held a kind of intermediate position between the
two great schools of heresy. While teaching, according to
Irenaeus, a system of aeons not unlike that of Valentinus, he
adopted in full the notions of Marcion as to abstinence from
marriage, from the eating of flesh, and from the use of wine,
and may have been the founder of a separate sect called
Encratites<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c008'><sup>[759]</sup></a>. We hear, too, of one Prepon, “an Assyrian” or
native of Syria, a follower of Marcion, whom Hippolytus
represents as teaching that Jesus Himself was intermediate
between the good and evil deities and came down to earth to
be freed from all evil<a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c008'><sup>[760]</sup></a>. Rhodo also speaks<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c008'><sup>[761]</sup></a> of Potitus and
Basilicus, followers of Marcion, who held fast to his doctrine of
two principles, while Syneros, as he affirms, led a school which
asserted that there were three “natures.” Lucian also, who,
according to Hippolytus and Epiphanius, came in point of
time between Marcion and Apelles<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c008'><sup>[762]</sup></a>, may have inclined to the
same doctrine, and taught, unlike Marcion, that there would be
a resurrection, not of the body nor of the soul, but of some part
of man which he also defined as being of a “third nature<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c008'><sup>[763]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversion of Constantine put a violent end to any open
propagation of the doctrines of Marcion or his successors. In
the picturesque words of Eusebius “the lurking-places of the
heretics were broken up by the Emperor’s commands, and the
savage beasts which they harboured were put to flight.”
Hence, he goes on to tell us, many of those who had been
“deceived” crept secretly into the Church, and were ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>secure their own safety by every sort of dissimulation<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c008'><sup>[764]</sup></a>. This
practice, as we have seen, had always been popular among the
Gnostics properly so called, whose religion consisted in part in
the knowledge of the formulas secretly imparted and preserved
with jealous care from all but the initiated. Although there is
no distinct proof that the same course was now adopted by the
Marcionites, there is some reason for thinking that this was the
case. The postponement of baptism noticed above must have
early divided the members of the Marcionite churches into
grades of which the largest was in an inferior position to the
others. It is unlikely that these catechumens, who might
witness but not share in the sacraments celebrated for their
higher-placed brethren, should have courted persecution on
behalf of a faith with which they were not fully entrusted.
The outbreak of the Arian controversy, which followed so
closely on the conversion of Constantine, also carried within the
Catholic Church those speculations about the Divine nature
which had hitherto formed a fruitful source of dissension among
the Marcionites themselves. With their synagogues and
meeting-places taken away from them and handed over to the
Catholics, many of them must have looked about for some
tolerated community which they could join, and of all that thus
offered themselves, the Catholic Church offered the greatest
inducements to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet another way was open to the convinced Marcionite who
could not bring himself to reject Marcion’s view that the true
purport of Jesus’ teaching had been obscured by the additions
of Judaizing apostles. The sect of the followers of Manes,
who began to show themselves in the Western part of the
Roman Empire shortly before Constantine’s conversion, professed
a dualism more uncompromising than any that Marcion
had taught, and coupled with it an organization so skilful and
effective that it was able for some ten centuries longer to defy
the efforts of the rest of Christendom for its suppression. In
its division of all Manichaeans into the two great classes of
Perfect and Hearers it drew very close to Marcionite practice;
and the liberty which it allowed the Hearers of outwardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>professing any faith they pleased must have enabled the
Marcionite who joined it to keep those articles of his former
creed most dear to him without coming into violent collision
with either Church or State. Hence the tradition seems well
founded which asserts that the majority of those Marcionites,
who did not become reconciled with the Catholic Church after
Constantine’s alliance with it, joined the ranks of the Manichaeans,
and so ceased to exist as a separate community<a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c008'><sup>[765]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The direct influence of Marcion’s teaching upon that of the
Catholic Church was probably very small. In spite of the
efforts of recent writers to maintain the contrary<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c008'><sup>[766]</sup></a>, it is difficult
to see that this first attempt, honest and sincere as it undoubtedly
was, at the reformation of Christianity ever bore
fruit of lasting value. Its main principle which, as we have
seen, was the rejection of the Jewish scriptures and their bearing
upon the Mission of Jesus, has been ignored, since Marcion’s
death as in his lifetime, by every other Church and sect professing
Christian doctrines. His common-sense view, that the
words of the Christian Bible must mean what their authors and
their contemporaries would have naturally taken them to mean,
and do not for the most part contain any deeply hidden or
allegorical significance, was in like manner repudiated by the
whole of Christendom, which, up to the latter part of the <abbr title='nineteenth'><span class='fss'>XIX</span>th</abbr>
century, continued to construe the greater part of its sacred
books by trope and figure<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c008'><sup>[767]</sup></a>. There remains then only the
asceticism and austerity that Marcion practised which the
orthodox could have borrowed from him. But, we have seen
that the religious abstinence from procreation, and from the
use of meat and wine, can be traced back to the appearance of
Orphism in Greece some five hundred years before the Birth of
Christ; and if the Christian Church adopted, as it partly did,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>these practices in a modified form, it was by way of inheritance
from a source which was much nearer to it than Marcion’s
heresy. That many of Marcion’s ideas have been revived in
our own day is likely enough, and this opinion has been put
forward with much skill and point by Dr Foakes-Jackson in
his Hulsean Lectures. But this is a case of revival rather than
of descent, and a reformer who has to wait some eighteen
centuries before his ideas meet with acceptance, may well be
held to have failed to influence after ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this, the heresy of Marcion will always have
great interest for the student of the History of Religions. The
success—fugitive as such things go, but real enough for a
time—with which Marcion set up a Church over against that
tremendous polity which has been called without much exaggeration
“the very master-piece of human wisdom,” would be alone
sufficient to make it precious in the eyes of those who are not
blind to the romance of history. To archaeologists it is the
more interesting that it is only in its direction that we are likely
to receive in future much additional light upon the struggles of
nascent Christianity with one category of its competitors. The
very voluminous writings of the other Gnostics were destroyed
by the triumphant Church with such minute care that the Coptic
texts described in the last chapter form the only relics of this
once enormous literature that have survived to us. The heathen
religions which for some time disputed the ground with the
Church have also left few traces partly for the same reason,
and partly because the secrecy to which they pledged their
votaries made it unlikely that many written documents of these
faiths would survive. But the <i>Antitheses</i> of Marcion were in
the hands of Photius in the <abbr title='tenth'><span class='fss'>X</span>th</abbr> century; and, although it is
dangerous to prophesy in such matters, it is by no means
impossible that some lucky discovery within the borders of the
Turkish Empire may yet give us a <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> that will enable us to
reconstruct them. If that should ever be the case, we shall be
in a far better position than we are now to decide whether the
analogies between Marcionism and Protestantism that have been
detected of late years are essential or superficial.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Few of us, perhaps, are inclined to recognize that, from its
first establishment down to the Mahommedan Invasion of the
<abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr> century, the Roman Empire found itself constantly in the
presence of a bitter, determined, and often victorious enemy.
Alexander had conquered but had not destroyed the Persians;
and, although the magic of the hero’s personality held them
faithful to him during his too brief life, he was no sooner dead
than they hastened to prove that they had no intention of
tamely giving up their nationality. Peucestas, the Royal bodyguard
who received the satrapy of Persia itself on his master’s
death, and was confirmed in it at the first shuffling of the cards
at Triparadisus, found it expedient to adopt the Persian
language and dress, with the result that his subjects conceived
for him an affection only equal to that which they afterwards
showed for Seleucus<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c008'><sup>[768]</sup></a>. Later, when the rise of the Parthian
power under Arsaces brought about the defeat of Seleucus <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II</span></abbr>
Callinicus, the opposition to European forms of government
found a centre further north<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c008'><sup>[769]</sup></a>, whence armies of lightly-equipped
horsemen were able to raid up to the Eastern shores of the
Mediterranean<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c008'><sup>[770]</sup></a>. Thanks probably to the knowledge of this
support in reserve, when Western Asia found the military power
of the Greek kings becoming exhausted by internecine wars,
she began to throw off the alien civilization that she had in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>part acquired, and to return more and more to Persian ways<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c008'><sup>[771]</sup></a>.
When the Romans in their turn set to work to eat up the
enfeebled Greek kingdoms, they quickly found themselves in
presence of a revived nationality as firmly held and nearly as
aggressive as their own, and henceforth Roman and Parthian
were seldom at peace. The long struggle with Mithridates, who
gave himself out as a descendant of Darius<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c008'><sup>[772]</sup></a>, taught the Romans
how strong was the reaction towards Persian nationality even
in Asia Minor, and the overthrow of Crassus by the Parthians
convinced his countrymen for a time of the folly of pushing
their arms too far eastwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the establishment of the Empire, the antagonism
between Rome and Persia became still more strongly marked,
and a struggle commenced which lasted with little intermission
until the foundation of the Mahommedan Caliphate. In this
struggle the advantage was not always, as we should like to
think, on the side of the Europeans. While Augustus reigns,
Horace boasts, there is no occasion to dread the “dreadful
Parthians<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c008'><sup>[773]</sup></a>”; but Corbulo is perpetually fighting them, and
when Nero commits suicide, the legend immediately springs up
that the tyrant is not dead, but has only betaken himself beyond
the Euphrates to return with an army of Rome’s most dreaded
enemies to lay waste his rebellious country<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c008'><sup>[774]</sup></a>. Towards the close
of the first Christian century, Trajan, fired, according to Gibbon,
by the example of Alexander, led an army into the East and
achieved successes which enabled him to add to his titles that
of Parthicus<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c008'><sup>[775]</sup></a>; but the whole of his Oriental conquests were
given back by the prudent Hadrian on his succession to the
throne. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, Avidius Cassius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>obtained some solid victories on the frontier; but Macrinus is
said to have bought off the Parthians with a bribe of nearly
two millions of money. The rise of the Sassanian house and
the retransfer of the leadership from the Parthians to their
kinsmen in Persia proper brought about the reform of the Persian
religion, and added another impulse to the increasing strength
of Persian national feeling. Alexander Severus may have
gained some successes in the field over Ardeshîr or Artaxerxes,
the restorer of the Persian monarchy<a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c008'><sup>[776]</sup></a>; but in the reign of the
last named king’s son and successor Sapor, the capture of the
Emperor Valerian with his whole army, and the subsequent
ravaging of the Roman provinces in Asia by the victors, showed
the Republic how terrible was the might of the restored kingdom<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c008'><sup>[777]</sup></a>.
Aurelian, the conqueror of Palmyra, did much to restore the
prestige of Roman arms in the East; and although he was
assassinated when on the march against Persia, the Emperor
Carus shortly after led a successful expedition into the heart of
the Persian kingdom<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c008'><sup>[778]</sup></a>. In the reign of Diocletian, indeed, the
Persians lost five provinces to the Romans<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c008'><sup>[779]</sup></a>; but under
Constantine the Great the Romans were again vanquished in
the field, and the Persians were only prevented by the heroic
resistance of the fortified town of Nisibis and an incursion into
their Eastern provinces of tribes from Central Asia from again
overrunning the Asiatic possessions of Rome<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c008'><sup>[780]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henceforward, the history of the long contest between the
two great empires—“the eyes,” as the Persian ambassador
told Galerius, “of the civilized world<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c008'><sup>[781]</sup></a>,” is the record of almost
uninterrupted advance on the part of Persia and of continual
retreat on the side of Rome. The patriotic enthusiasm of a
Julian, and the military genius of a Belisarius, aided by the
dynastic revolutions common among Oriental nations, might for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>a time arrest the progress of the conquering Persians; but, bit
by bit, the Asiatic provinces slipped out of the grasp of the
European masters of Constantinople. In 603 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, it looked as
if Persia were at length in the position to deliver the final blow
in a war which had lasted for more than five centuries. By the
invasion of Chosroes and his successive captures of Antioch,
Jerusalem, and Egypt, it seemed as if the Persians had restored
the world-empire of Cambyses and Darius; but the Persians
then discovered, as Xerxes had done a millennium earlier, how
dangerous it is for Orientals, even when flushed by conquest,
to press Europeans too far. The Roman Emperor Heraclius,
who never before or afterwards gave much proof of military or
political capacity, from his besieged capital of Constantinople
collected an army with which he dashed into Persia in a manner
worthy of Alexander himself. After six brilliant campaigns he
dictated to the Persians a triumphant peace in the very heart
of their empire<a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c008'><sup>[782]</sup></a>. A few years later, and its shattered and
disorganized remains fell an easy prey to the Mahommedan
invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of this long rivalry might have been expected to
produce in the Romans during its continuance a hearty dislike
of the customs and institutions of the nation opposed to them;
but almost the exact contrary was the result. It may be argued
that Rome’s proved skill in government was in no small
measure due to her ready adoption of all that seemed to her
admirable in the nations that she overcame. Or it may be that
the influence which the memory of Alexander exercised over all
those who succeeded to his empire led them to imitate him in
his assumption of Persian manners. The fact remains that, long
before the division of the Roman Empire into East and West,
the Romans displayed a taste for Oriental luxury and magnificence
which seems entirely at variance with the simplicity and
austerity of the republican conquerors of Carthage. It is
hardly too much to say that while Alexander’s conscious aim
was to make Asia Greek, the Romans, on possessing themselves
of his Asiatic conquests, allowed themselves to become to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>great extent “Medized,” and showed an unexpected admiration
for the habits and culture of Alexander’s Persian subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may of course be said that this was in external matters
only, and that the “Persian furniture” which excited Horace’s
wrath<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c008'><sup>[783]</sup></a> might if it stood alone be looked upon as merely a
passing fashion; but the Court ceremonial introduced by
Diocletian argues a steady tendency towards Persian customs
and forms of government that must have been in operation for
centuries. The household of a Julian Caesar was no differently
arranged from that of a Roman noble of the period, and his
title of Prince of the Senate showed that he was only looked
upon as the first of his equals. But Diocletian was in all respects
but language a Persian emperor or Shah, and his style of “Lord
and God,” his diadem, his silken state dress, the elaborate
ritual of his court, and the long hierarchy of its officials, were
all designed to compel his subjects to recognize the fact<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c008'><sup>[784]</sup></a>. As
usual, the official form of religion in the Roman Empire had
for some time given indications of the coming change in the
form of government. The sun had always been the principal
natural object worshipped by the Persians, and a high-priest
of the Sun-God had sat upon the Imperial throne of Rome in
the form of the miserable Heliogabalus. Only 13 years before
Diocletian, Aurelian, son of another Sun-God’s priestess and as
virile and rugged as his predecessor was soft and effeminate,
had also made the Sun-God the object of his special devotion
and of an official worship. Hence Diocletian and his colleague
Galerius were assured in advance of the approval of a large part
of their subjects when they took the final plunge in 307 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>,
and proclaimed Mithras, “the Unconquered Sun-God,” the
Protector of their Empire<a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c008'><sup>[785]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of this, however, it is very difficult to say how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Mithras originally became known to the Romans. Plutarch
says indeed that his cult was first introduced by the Cilician
pirates who were put down by Pompey<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c008'><sup>[786]</sup></a>. This is not likely to
be literally true; for the summary methods adopted by these
sea-robbers towards their Roman prisoners hardly gave much
time for proselytism, while most of the pirates whom Pompey
spared at the close of his successful operations he deported to
Achaea, which was one of the few places within the Empire
where the Mithraic faith did not afterwards show itself. What
Plutarch’s story probably means is that the worship of Mithras
first came to Rome from Asia Minor, and there are many facts
which go to confirm this. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, the historian of Mithraism,
has shown that, long before the Romans set foot in Asia,
there were many colonies of emigrants from Persia who with
their <i>magi</i> or priests had settled in Asia Minor, including in that
phrase Galatia, Phrygia, Lydia, and probably Cilicia<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c008'><sup>[787]</sup></a>. When
Rome began to absorb these provinces, slaves, prisoners, and
merchants from them would naturally find their way to Rome,
and in time would no doubt draw together for the worship of
their national deities in the way that we have seen pursued
by the worshippers of the Alexandrian Isis and the Jewish
exiles. The <i>magi</i> of Asia Minor were great supporters of
Mithridates, and the Mithridatic wars were no doubt responsible
for a large number of these immigrants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once introduced, however, the worship of Mithras spread
like wild-fire. The legions from the first took kindly to it, and
this is the less surprising when we find that many of them
were recruited under the earliest emperors in Anatolian states
like Commagene, where the cult was, if not indigenous, yet of
very early growth<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c008'><sup>[788]</sup></a>. Moreover the wars of the Romans against
the Persians kept them constantly in the border provinces of the
two empires, where the native populations not infrequently
changed masters. The enemy’s town that the legions besieged
one year might therefore give them a friendly reception the next;
and there was thus abundant opportunity for the acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of both sides with each others’ customs. When the Roman troops
marched back to Europe, as was constantly the case during the
civil wars which broke out on the downfall of the Julian house,
they took back with them the worship of the new god whom they
had adopted, and he thus became known through almost the
whole of the Roman Empire<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c008'><sup>[789]</sup></a>. “From the shores of the
Euxine to the north of Brittany and to the fringe of the Sahara<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c008'><sup>[790]</sup></a>,”
as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont says, its monuments abound, and, he might have
added, they have been met with also in the Egyptian Delta, in
Babylon, and on the northern frontiers of India. In our own
barbarous country we have found them not only in London and
York, but as far west as Gloucester and Chester and as far
north as Carlisle and Newcastle<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c008'><sup>[791]</sup></a>. The Balkan countries, like
Italy, Germany, Southern France, and Spain, are full of them;
but there was one part of the Roman Empire into which they
did not penetrate freely. This was Greece, where the memories of
the Persian Wars long survived the independence of the country,
and where the descendants of those who fought at Salamis,
Marathon, and Thermopylae would have nothing to do with a
god coming from the invaders’ fatherland. It is only very lately
that the remains of Mithras-worship have been discovered at
the Piraeus and at Patras, in circumstances which show pretty
clearly that it was there practised only by foreigners<a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c008'><sup>[792]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this popularity, it is not easy to say exactly
what god Mithras’ European worshippers considered him to be.
If length of ancestry went for anything in such matters, he
might indeed claim a greater antiquity than any deity of the
later Roman Pantheon, with the single exception of the Alexandrian
gods. Mithras was certainly worshipped in Vedic India,
where his name of Mitra constantly occurs in the sacred texts
as the “shining one,” meaning apparently the material sun<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c008'><sup>[793]</sup></a>.
He is there invoked in company with Varuna, generally considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the god of the sky, and therefore according to some,
the prototype of the Greek Zeus and the Latin Jupiter<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c008'><sup>[794]</sup></a>. His
appearance in a similar connection in the sacred books of the
Persians led the founders of the comparative study of religion
to think that he must have been one of the primitive gods of
their hypothetical Aryan race, and that his worship must go
back to the imaginary time when Persians and Hindus dwelt
side by side in the plains of Cashmere. But this theory is
giving way before proof that the original home of the Indo-European
race was Europe, and has been badly shaken by the
discovery at Boghaz Keui of tablets showing that the gods
Mithra and Varuna were gods of the Mitannians or Hittites<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c008'><sup>[795]</sup></a> at
some date earlier than 1500 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and therefore long before the
appearance of the Persians in history. If the worship of
Mithras were not indigenous in Western Asia, it may therefore
well have come there independently of the Persians<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c008'><sup>[796]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt, however, that the roots of Mithras-worship
went very far down into the Persian religion. In the
Yashts or hymns which are the earliest evidence of primitive
Iranian beliefs, Mithra—to use the Avestic spelling of his name—frequently
appears, not indeed as the material sun, but as the
“genius of the heavenly light” which lightens the whole
universe<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c008'><sup>[797]</sup></a> and is the most beneficent among the powers of
Nature. Mithras is not here, however, the Supreme Being,
nor even the highest among the gods benevolent to man. This
last place is occupied in the Zend Avesta by Ahura Mazda,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“the omniscient lord,” who appears to be the Persian form of
Varuna, the god of the sky whom we have seen associated with
Mitra in the Vedas<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c008'><sup>[798]</sup></a>. Nor is Mithras in the Zend Avesta one
of the six Amshaspands, the deified abstractions or personified
attributes of Ahura Mazda, who, in the later developments of
the Persian religion, occupy towards him much the same position
that the “Roots” of Simon Magus and the Aeons of the
Pleroma among the Gnostics do towards the Boundless Power
or the Ineffable Bythos<a id='r799'></a><a href='#f799' class='c008'><sup>[799]</sup></a>. In the later Avestic literature, he
appears as the chief of the Izeds or Yazatas, a race of genii
created by Ahura Mazda, who are the protectors of his universe
and the helpers of mankind in their warfare against the powers
of darkness<a id='r800'></a><a href='#f800' class='c008'><sup>[800]</sup></a>. In the latest as in the earliest Persian view of
the personality of Mithras, therefore, it is plain that he occupies
an intermediate position between the Creator and man.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not, however, in the religion associated with the name
of Zoroaster that we must look for the origin of Mithraism.
The date of the sacred books of Mazdeism and the historical
existence of Zoroaster himself have recently been brought down
to as late as the <abbr title='seventh'>VIIth</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr><a id='r801'></a><a href='#f801' class='c008'><sup>[801]</sup></a> and the appearance in Asia
of the Persian tribes as conquerors, whereas Mithras was, as
we have seen, worshipped in Asia Minor nearly a millennium
earlier. Moreover, the strict dualism which set Ahriman, the
god of darkness and evil, in eternal and perhaps equal opposition
to Ormuzd, the god of light and goodness, seems to have been
unknown before the Sassanid reform in 226 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, by which time
the worship of Mithras in Europe was at its apogee<a id='r802'></a><a href='#f802' class='c008'><sup>[802]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr>
Cumont is, therefore, doubtless right when he thinks that
Mithraism was derived not from Mazdeism, but from Magism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>or the religion of the Magi, the tribe of Medes whose domination
was put an end to by Darius the son of Hystaspes, and whose
name was afterwards given to a priestly caste and has passed
into our own language as the root of the word “magic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That these Magi practised a religion different from that
taught in the Avestic literature is plain enough. The romantic
story told by Herodotus of the Magian who seized the throne
of Persia during Cambyses’ absence in Egypt on the pretence
that he was the king’s brother whom Cambyses had privily put
to death<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c008'><sup>[803]</sup></a>, is fully confirmed by Darius’ trilingual inscription on
the Rock of Behistun, first copied and deciphered by Sir Henry
Rawlinson and lately published in elaborate form by the British
Museum<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c008'><sup>[804]</sup></a>. Darius here narrates how “a certain man, a Magian,
Gaumata by name ... lied unto the people (saying) ‘I am
Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, the brother of Cambyses.’ Then
all the people revolted from Cambyses and went over to him,
even Persia and Media and the other provinces.” Darius goes
on to record that “thereupon Cambyses died by his own hand<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c008'><sup>[805]</sup></a>,”
that the seven Persian nobles overthrew the pretender much
in the way described by Herodotus, and that “I rebuilt the
temples of the gods, which that Gaumata, the Magian, had
destroyed. I restored that which had been taken away as it
was in the days of old<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c008'><sup>[806]</sup></a>.” This he tells us he did “by the grace
of Ahura Mazda,” and that by this grace he always acted.
The memory of these events was kept up by the festival of the
Magophonia or Massacre of the Magi which was yearly celebrated
in Persia and during which no Magus dared show himself
in the streets<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c008'><sup>[807]</sup></a>. Darius’ words show that there was a religious
as well as a dynastic side to the Magian revolt, though whether
the false Smerdis restored the old worship of the land, which
he found in danger of being supplanted by Zoroastrianism or
the worship of Ahura Mazda, may still be doubtful. In any
event, the reformation or counter-reformation made by Darius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>did not succeed in entirely uprooting the old Magian faith, for
Herodotus speaks of the Magi as still being in his time the
priestly caste among the Persians, and as acting as diviners and
sacrificers to the Achaemenian kings who ruled Persia up to
Alexander’s Conquest<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c008'><sup>[808]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Magian religion as it appears in Herodotus and other
Greek authors, however, seems to have shown none of the
hostility to the powers of darkness so apparent in the religious
literature collected by the Sassanian kings. “The whole
circuit of the firmament” was, according to Herodotus, their
greatest god or Zeus; and he says that they also “sacrifice to
the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire and water, and to the
winds”; but that “they do not, like the Greeks, believe the
gods to have the same nature as men<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c008'><sup>[809]</sup></a>.” He also tells us that
later they borrowed from the Arabians and the Assyrians the
worship of a goddess whom he calls Mitra, and although he is
probably wrong as to the origin and sex of this deity, his evidence
shows that Semitic admixture counted for something in the
Magian worship. In other respects, the Magian seems to have
been a primitive faith given up to the worship of the powers
of nature or elements, which it did not personify in the
anthropomorphic manner of either the Semites or the Greeks,
and to have paid little attention to public ceremonies or ritual.
It follows therefore that, like the religions of many uncivilized
people of the present day, it would draw no very sharp distinction
between good and evil gods, and would be as ready to
propitiate or make use of the evil, that is those hostile to man,
as the good or benevolent. Plutarch, who describes the religion
of the Magi more than three centuries after Herodotus, when
the name of Zoroaster the Persian prophet and the dualistic
belief favoured by his teaching had long been popularly known
in the West, says that the Magi of his time held Mithras to be
the “Mediator” or intermediary between “Oromazes” or Light
on the one hand, and “Areimanios” or Darkness and Ignorance
on the other, and that they used to make bloody sacrifices
to the last-named in a place where the sun never comes<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c008'><sup>[810]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>It is easy to see how such a cult, without the control of public
ceremonies and with its unabashed traffic with the powers of
evil, would be likely to degenerate into compulsion or magic.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was, however, another popular superstition or belief
which, about the time when Mithraism made its appearance in
Europe, had spread itself over Western Asia. This was the
idea that the positions and changes of the heavenly bodies
exercise an influence over the affairs of the world and the lot
both of kingdoms and individual men. It probably began in
Babylonia, where the inhabitants had from Sumerian times
shown themselves great observers of the stars, and had been
accustomed to record the omens that they drew from their
motions for the guidance of the kings<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c008'><sup>[811]</sup></a>. This kind of divination—or
astrology to call it by a familiar name—received a great
impulse after Alexander’s Conquest, in the first place from the
break up of the Euphratean priestly colleges before referred to,
and the driving out of the lesser priests therein to get their own
living, and then from the fact that the scientific enquiry and
mathematical genius of the Greeks had made the calculation of
the positions of the heavenly bodies at any given date and hour
a fairly simple matter to be determined without direct observation<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c008'><sup>[812]</sup></a>.
It was probably no mere coincidence that the Chaldaei
and the Mathematici, as the astrologers called themselves,
should have swarmed at Rome under just those emperors in
whose reigns Mithraism began to push itself to the front<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c008'><sup>[813]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we may be sure that these factors, the religion of the
Magi, the practice of magic, and the astrological art, all counted
in the composition of the worship of Mithras, we yet know but
very little of its tenets. No work has come down to us from
any devotee of Mithras which will give us the same light on
the way his worshippers regarded him that the romance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Apuleius and the encomium of Aelius Aristides have cast on
the mental attitude of the devotees of the Alexandrian cult.
The extensive books of Eubulus and Pallas on Mithras and the
history of his worship, which Porphyry tells us were extant from
the reign of Hadrian down to his own time<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c008'><sup>[814]</sup></a>, are entirely lost,
and our only source of information, except a very few scattered
notices in the Fathers and in profane writers like the Emperor
Julian and Porphyry himself, are the sculptures and inscriptions
which have been found in his ruined chapels. These texts and
monuments the scholarly care of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has gathered into
two large volumes, which will always remain the chief source
from which later enquirers must draw their materials<a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c008'><sup>[815]</sup></a>. From
their study he comes to the conclusion that, in the religion of
Mithras, there figured above him the Mazdean gods of good and
evil respectively called in the Zend Avesta Ahura Mazda and
Angro Mainyus, or in more familiar language, Ormuzd and Ahriman.
Behind and above these again, he would place a Supreme
Being called Zervan Akerene or Boundless Time, who seems to
be without attributes or qualities, and to have acted only as the
progenitor of the opposing couple. This is at first sight very
probable, because the Orphic doctrine, which, as we have seen,
made Chronos or Time the progenitor of all the gods, was widely
spread in Asia Minor before Alexander’s Conquest, and the
Persian colonies formed there under his successors must therefore
have come in frequent contact with this most accommodating
of schools<a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c008'><sup>[816]</sup></a>. Traditions of a sect of Zervanists in Western
Asia, who taught that all things came from Infinite Time, are
also to be found<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c008'><sup>[817]</sup></a>. But most of these are recorded after
Mithraism had become extinct; and <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s proofs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>existence of this dogma in the European religion of Mithras can
be reduced on final analysis to a quotation from a treatise by
Theodore, the Christian bishop of Mopsuestia who died in
428 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, directed, as it would seem, against the “Magi” of
his time, in which he admits that their dogmas had never been
written, and that the sectaries in question, whom he calls
Magusaeans, said “sometimes one thing and deceived themselves,
and sometimes another and deceived the ignorant<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c008'><sup>[818]</sup></a>.”
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s identification of the lion-headed statue often found
in Mithraic chapels with the Supreme God of the system has
been shown elsewhere to be open to serious question, and the
figure itself to be susceptible of another interpretation than
that which he would put upon it<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c008'><sup>[819]</sup></a>. On the whole, therefore,
while <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s mastery of his subject makes it very
dangerous to differ from him, it seems that his theory of a
Boundless Time as the pinnacle of the Mithraist pantheon
cannot be considered as proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether Ormuzd and Ahriman played any important part
in the Roman worship of Mithras is also doubtful. With regard
to the first-named, both Greeks and Romans knew him well and
identified him unhesitatingly with Zeus and Jupiter<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c008'><sup>[820]</sup></a>. Hence
we should expect to find him, if represented at all on the
Mithraic sculptures, with the well-known features, the thunderbolt,
and the eagle, which long before this time had become the
conventional attributes of the Roman as well as of the Homeric
father of gods and men. We are not entirely disappointed, for
we find in a bas-relief formerly in a chapel of Mithras at Sissek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>(the ancient Sissia in Pannonia) and now in the Museum at
Agram, the bull-slaying scene in which Mithras figures and
which will be presently described, surmounted by an arch on
which is ranged Jupiter seated on his throne, grasping the
thunderbolt, wielding the sceptre, and occupying the place of
honour in a group of gods among whom we may distinguish
Mars and Mercury<a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c008'><sup>[821]</sup></a>. In another bas-relief of the same scene,
now at the Rudolfinum in Klagenfurt, he is depicted in a similar
position in an assembly of the gods, which although much
mutilated seems to show Zeus or Jupiter in the centre with
Hera or Juno by his side<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c008'><sup>[822]</sup></a>. But the most conclusive of these
monuments is the great bas-relief found at Osterburken in the
Odenwald, wherein the arch surmounting the usual bull-slaying
scene contains an assembly of twelve gods with Zeus in the
centre armed with thunderbolt and sceptre, while around him
are grouped Apollo, Ares, Heracles, Hera, Athena, Aphrodite,
Nike, Poseidon, Artemis, Hades, and perhaps Persephone<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c008'><sup>[823]</sup></a>.
When by the side of these we put the many inscriptions left by
the legionaries to “the holy gods of the fatherland, to Jupiter
best and greatest, and to the Unconquered One”; to “Jupiter
best and greatest, and to the divine Sun, the Unconquered Sun,”
and other well-known names of Mithras, there can be no doubt
that his worshippers used to adore him together with the head
of the Roman Pantheon, and that they considered Mithras in
some way the subordinate of or inferior to Jupiter<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c008'><sup>[824]</sup></a>. Yet there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>is nothing to show that the Mithraists as such identified in any
way this Jupiter Optimus Maximus with the Persian Ahura
Mazda, Oromasdes, or Ormuzd, or that they ever knew him by
any of these outlandish names.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case is different with Ormuzd’s enemy Ahriman, who
evidently was known by his Persian name to the Roman
worshippers of Mithras. In the Vatican can be seen a triangular
marble altar dedicated by a <i>clarissimus</i> named Agrestius who
was a high-priest of Mithras, to “the god Arimanius<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c008'><sup>[825]</sup></a>,” and
altars with similar inscriptions have been found at Buda-Pesth<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c008'><sup>[826]</sup></a>.
At a Mithraic chapel in York also, there was found a statue, now
in the Museum of the Philosophical Society in that city, which
bears an inscription to the same god Arimanius<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c008'><sup>[827]</sup></a>. There is
therefore fairly clear evidence that the Mithraists recognized
Ahriman under his Persian name, and that they sacrificed to
him, as Plutarch said the “magi” of his time did to the god
whom he calls Hades<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c008'><sup>[828]</sup></a>, and this agrees with Herodotus’ statement
that the Persians used to do the same to “the god who is
said to be beneath the earth<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c008'><sup>[829]</sup></a>.” Although this gave occasion
to the Christian Fathers to accuse the Mithraists of worshipping
the devil, we are not thereby bound to conclude that they
looked upon Arimanius as an essentially evil being. It seems
more probable that they considered him, as the Greeks did their
Hades or Pluto, as a chthonian or subterranean power ruling over
a place of darkness and discomfort, where there were punishments
indeed, but not as a deity insusceptible of propitiation by
sacrifice<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c008'><sup>[830]</sup></a>, or compulsion by other means such as magic arts<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c008'><sup>[831]</sup></a>. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>has been shown elsewhere that his image in a form which fairly
represents his attributes in this capacity appears with some
frequency in the Mithraic chapels, where a certain amount of
mystery attached to its exhibition<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c008'><sup>[832]</sup></a>. It seems to follow from
these considerations that the worshippers of Mithras attributed
to their special god no inferiority to Ahriman as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s
argument supposes, and that the only power whom they acknowledged
as higher than Mithras himself was the Roman
equivalent of Ormuzd, the Jupiter Optimus Maximus adored
throughout the Roman Empire of their time as the head of the
Pantheon<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c008'><sup>[833]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The connection of Mithras with the sun is also by no means
easy to unravel. The Vedic Mitra was, as we have seen,
originally the material sun itself, and the many hundreds of
votive inscriptions left by the worshippers of Mithras to “the
unconquered Sun Mithras<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c008'><sup>[834]</sup></a>,” to the unconquered solar divinity
(<i>numen</i>) Mithras<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c008'><sup>[835]</sup></a>, to the unconquered Sun-God (<i>deus</i>) Mithra<a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c008'><sup>[836]</sup></a>,
and allusions in them to the priests (<i>sacerdotes</i>), worshippers
(<i>cultores</i>), and temples (<i>templum</i>) of the same deity leave no
doubt open that he was in Roman times a sun-god<a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c008'><sup>[837]</sup></a>. Yet this
does not necessarily mean that he was actually the day-star
visible to mankind, and the Greeks knew well enough how to
distinguish between Apollo the god of light who was once at
any rate a sun-god, and Helios the Sun itself<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c008'><sup>[838]</sup></a>. On the Mithraic
sculptures, we frequently see the unmistakable figure of Mithras
riding in the chariot of the Sun-God driven by the divinity with
long hair and a rayed nimbus, whom we know to be this Helios
or his Roman equivalent, going through some ceremony of consecration
with him, receiving messages from him, and seated side
by side with him at a banquet which is evidently a ritual feast.
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont explains this by the theory that Mithras, while in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Persia and in the earliest Aryan traditions the genius of the
celestial light only<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c008'><sup>[839]</sup></a>, no sooner passed into Semitic countries
and became affected by the astrological theories of the Chaldaeans,
than he was identified with their sun-god Shamash<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c008'><sup>[840]</sup></a>,
and this seems as reasonable a theory as can be devised. Another
way of accounting for what he calls the “at first sight contradictory
proposition” that Mithras at once was and was not the
sun<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c008'><sup>[841]</sup></a>, is to suppose that while the Mithraists wished those who
did not belong to their faith to believe that they themselves
worshipped the visible luminary, they yet instructed their
votaries in private that he was a deity superior to it and in fact
the power behind it. As we shall see, the two theories are by
no means irreconcilable, although absolute proof of neither can
yet be offered.</p>

<p class='c007'>One can speak with more certainty about the Legend or
mythical history of Mithras which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has contrived
with rare acumen to reconstruct from the monuments found in
his chapels. It is comprised in eleven or twelve scenes or
tableaux which we will take in their order<a id='r842'></a><a href='#f842' class='c008'><sup>[842]</sup></a>. We first see the
birth of the god, not from the head of his father Zeus like Athena,
or from his thigh like Dionysos, but from a rock, which explains
his epithet of “Petrogenes” or rock-born. The god is represented
in this scene as struggling from the rock in which he is embedded
below the waist, and always uplifts in one hand a broad knife
of which we shall afterwards see him make use, and in the other
a lighted torch<a id='r843'></a><a href='#f843' class='c008'><sup>[843]</sup></a>. He is here represented as a boy, and wears the
Phrygian cap or so-called cap of liberty which is his distinctive
attribute, while the torch is doubtless, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont surmises,
symbolical of the light which he is bringing into the world<a id='r844'></a><a href='#f844' class='c008'><sup>[844]</sup></a>.
The rock is sometimes encircled by the folds of a large serpent,
probably here as elsewhere a symbol of the earth, and is in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Mithraic chapel discovered at Housesteads in Northumberland
represented in the form of an egg, the upper part remaining on
the head of the nascent god like an egg-shell on that of a newly-hatched
chicken<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c008'><sup>[845]</sup></a>. This is probably due to some confusion or
identification with the Orphic legend of the First-born or Phanes
who sprang from the cosmic egg; but the central idea of the
rock-birth seems to be that of the spark, hidden as it were in
the stone and leaping forth when struck. In one or two
examples of the scene, the miraculous birth is watched by a
shepherd or shepherds, which leads <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont to draw a
parallel between this and the Adoration of the Shepherds at
the Birth of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next two scenes are more difficult to interpret with
anything approaching certainty. In one of them<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c008'><sup>[846]</sup></a>, Mithras is
represented as standing upright before a tree from which he
cuts or tears a large branch bearing leaves and fruit. He is
here naked, save for the distinctive cap; but immediately
after, he is seen emerging from the leafage fully clothed in
Oriental dress. In the next scene—the relative order of the
scenes seems settled by the places they most often occupy on
different examples of the same sculptures<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c008'><sup>[847]</sup></a>—Mithras in the
Phrygian cap, Persian trousers, and flowing mantle generally
worn by him, kneels on one knee drawing a bow, the arrows
from which strike a rock in the distance and draw from it a
stream of water which a kneeling man receives in his hands
and lifts to his mouth<a id='r848'></a><a href='#f848' class='c008'><sup>[848]</sup></a>. Several variants of this scene exist,
in one of which a suppliant is kneeling before the archer-god
and raising his hands towards him as if in prayer; while in
another, the rock may well be a cloud. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont can only
suggest with regard to these scenes, that the first may be an
allusion to the Fall of Man and his subsequently clothing
himself with leaves as described in the Book of Genesis, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>that the second scene may depict a prolonged drought upon
earth, in which man prays to Mithras and is delivered by the
god’s miraculous production of rain. He admits, however, that
this is pure conjecture, and that he knows no Indian, Persian,
or Chaldaean legend or myth to which the scenes in question
can be certainly attached. It seems therefore useless to discuss
them further here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing on, we come to a series of scenes, the meaning of
which is more easily intelligible. In all of these a bull plays
a principal part. It is abundantly clear that this bull is no
terrestrial creature, but is the Goshurun or Heavenly Bull of the
Zend Avesta, from whose death come forth not only man, but
beasts, trees, and all the fruits of the earth<a id='r849'></a><a href='#f849' class='c008'><sup>[849]</sup></a>. In the Mithraic
sculptures, we see the Bull first sailing over the waters in a
cup-shaped boat<a id='r850'></a><a href='#f850' class='c008'><sup>[850]</sup></a> like the coracles still used on the Euphrates,
or escaping from a burning stable to which Mithras and a
companion have set fire<a id='r851'></a><a href='#f851' class='c008'><sup>[851]</sup></a>. Then he is depicted grazing peaceably
or raising his head now and then as if alarmed by some sudden
noise<a id='r852'></a><a href='#f852' class='c008'><sup>[852]</sup></a>. Next he is chased by Mithras, who seizes him by the
horns, mounts him<a id='r853'></a><a href='#f853' class='c008'><sup>[853]</sup></a>, and after a furious gallop casts him over
his shoulders, generally holding him by the hind legs so that
the horned head dangles to the ground<a id='r854'></a><a href='#f854' class='c008'><sup>[854]</sup></a>. In this position, he
is taken into the cave which forms the chapel of Mithras.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, if the order in the most complete monuments be
followed, we break off to enter upon another set of scenes which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>illustrate the relations between Mithras and the sun<a id='r855'></a><a href='#f855' class='c008'><sup>[855]</sup></a>. In what
again seems to be the first in order, we see Mithras upright with
a person kneeling before him who, from the rayed nimbus round
his head, is evidently the god Helios or Sol<a id='r856'></a><a href='#f856' class='c008'><sup>[856]</sup></a>. In one representation
of this scene, Mithras extends his left hand towards this
nimbus as if to replace it on the head of its wearer<a id='r857'></a><a href='#f857' class='c008'><sup>[857]</sup></a> from which
it has been displaced in yet another monument<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c008'><sup>[858]</sup></a>, while in the
other, he displays an object not unlike a Phrygian cap which may,
however, be, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont suggests, something like a water-skin<a id='r859'></a><a href='#f859' class='c008'><sup>[859]</sup></a>.
Generally, Mithras is represented as holding this object
over the bared head of the kneeling Sun-God, as if to crown him
with it<a id='r860'></a><a href='#f860' class='c008'><sup>[860]</sup></a>. Then we find Mithras with the ray-crowned Sun-God
upright beside him, while he grasps his hand in token, as it would
seem, of alliance or friendship<a id='r861'></a><a href='#f861' class='c008'><sup>[861]</sup></a>. If we accept the hint afforded
by the theory that the rock yielding water on being split by the
arrows of Mithras is really a cloud producing the fertilizing rain,
we may imagine that we have here the unconquered god removing
clouds which obscure the face of the great life-giving
luminary and restoring to him the crown of rays which enables
him to shed his kindly light upon the earth. The earth would
thus be made fit for the creation of man and other animals
which, as we shall see, follows; but in any event, the meaning
of the scene which shows the alliance is, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has
pointed out, not doubtful<a id='r862'></a><a href='#f862' class='c008'><sup>[862]</sup></a>. In one monument, where Mithras
grasps the hand of the person we have identified with the Sun-God
before an altar, he at the same time draws his sword, as if
to perform the exchange of blood or blood-covenant usual in
the East on swearing alliance<a id='r863'></a><a href='#f863' class='c008'><sup>[863]</sup></a>. Possibly the crowning scene, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span><abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont also suggests<a id='r864'></a><a href='#f864' class='c008'><sup>[864]</sup></a>, is to be connected with Tertullian’s
statement that in the initiation of the Mithraist to the degree
of <span lang="la"><i>miles</i></span> or soldier, he was offered at the sword’s point a crown,
which he cast away from him saying that Mithras was his crown.
If so, it would afford some proof that the initiate here, as in
the mysteries of Isis, was made to impersonate the sun, which
is on other grounds likely enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>We return to the scenes with the Bull, which here reach
their climax. This is the sacrifice of the Bull by Mithras,
which forms the central point of the whole legend. Its representation,
generally in bas-relief, was displayed in the most
conspicuous position in the apse of the Mithraic chapel, where
it occupied the place of the modern altar-piece, and such art
as the Roman sculptors succeeded in displaying was employed
to make it as impressive and as striking as possible<a id='r865'></a><a href='#f865' class='c008'><sup>[865]</sup></a>. It shows
the god grasping with his left hand the nostrils of the beast,
and kneeling with his left knee in the middle of the Bull’s back,
while with his right hand he plunges the broad-bladed dagger
with which he was armed at his birth into the Bull’s shoulder<a id='r866'></a><a href='#f866' class='c008'><sup>[866]</sup></a>.
A dog leaps forward to lap the blood flowing from the wound,
while at the same time a scorpion seizes the Bull by the genitals.
A serpent also forms part of the group, but his position varies
in the different monuments, while that of the other animals
does not. Sometimes, he lifts his head towards the blood, as
if to share it with the dog, sometimes he is extended along the
ground beneath the Bull’s belly in apparent indifference to the
tragedy enacted above him<a id='r867'></a><a href='#f867' class='c008'><sup>[867]</sup></a>. Before the Bull stands generally
a youth clothed like Mithras himself in Phrygian cap, tunic,
and mantle, as well as the anaxyrides or tight trousers in which
the Greeks depicted most Easterns, while another youth
similarly attired stands behind the dying victim. These two
human figures are alike in every particular save that one of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>bears a torch upright with the flame pointing upwards, while
the other holds a similar torch reversed so that the flame juts
towards the earth. We know from a Latin inscription that the
torch-bearer with uplifted torch was called Cautes, he with the
reversed one Cautopates, but of neither name has any satisfactory
derivation or etymology yet been discovered<a id='r868'></a><a href='#f868' class='c008'><sup>[868]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meaning of the group as a whole can, however, be
explained by the documents of the later Persian religion. The
<i>Bundahish</i> tells us that Ahura Mazda created before all things
the Bull Goshurun, who was killed by Ahriman, the god of evil,
and that from his side came forth Gayômort, first of men,
while from his tail there issued useful seed-plants and trees,
from his blood the vine, and from his seed the different kinds of
beasts<a id='r869'></a><a href='#f869' class='c008'><sup>[869]</sup></a>. Save that the bull-slayer is here not the god of evil
but the lord of light himself, the myth is evidently the same in
the Mithraic bas-reliefs, for in some of the earliest monuments
the Bull’s tail is actually shown sprouting into ears of wheat,
while in others the production of animals as a consequence of
the Bull’s death may be indicated, as well as the birth of the
vine<a id='r870'></a><a href='#f870' class='c008'><sup>[870]</sup></a>. That the dog plays the part of the guardian of the
Bull’s soul is probable from what we know of later Persian
beliefs<a id='r871'></a><a href='#f871' class='c008'><sup>[871]</sup></a>, while the scorpion as the creature of Ahriman may be
here represented as poisoning the seed of future life at its
source<a id='r872'></a><a href='#f872' class='c008'><sup>[872]</sup></a>. That Mithras is not supposed to kill the Bull from
enmity or other personal reasons, but in obedience to orders
from some higher power, is shown by the listening pose of his
head during the sacrifice. This is <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s opinion<a id='r873'></a><a href='#f873' class='c008'><sup>[873]</sup></a>, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>also that the serpent here takes no active part in the affair,
but is merely a symbolic representation of the earth<a id='r874'></a><a href='#f874' class='c008'><sup>[874]</sup></a>. The
whole drama is clearly shown as taking place in a cave or grotto,
as appears from the arch of rocks which surmounts, and, as it
were, acts as a frame to, the Tauroctony or bull-slaying scene
in most Mithraic chapels. This cave, according to Porphyry,
represents the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Legend, however, does not end with the death of the
Bull. In the chapel at Heddernheim, the great slab on which
the Tauroctony is sculptured in bas-relief is pivoted so as to
swing round and display on its other face another scene which
we find repeated in a slightly different form on many monuments<a id='r875'></a><a href='#f875' class='c008'><sup>[875]</sup></a>.
Mithras and the Sun-God are here shown as partaking
of a ritual feast or banquet in which grapes seem to figure. At
Heddernheim, the grapes are tendered to the two gods over
the body of the dead bull by the two torch-bearing figures
Cautes and Cautopates, while on an arch above them various
quadrupeds, dogs, a boar, a sheep, and a cow, are seen springing
into life. In other monuments, the same scene generally
appears as a banquet at which Mithras and Helios are seated
side by side at a table sometimes alone, but at others in company
with different persons who can hardly be any other than
initiates or worshippers<a id='r876'></a><a href='#f876' class='c008'><sup>[876]</sup></a>. That this represents some sort of
sacrament where a drink giving immortality was administered
seems probable, and its likeness to representations of the Last
Supper is sufficient to explain the complaint of Justin Martyr
and other Fathers that the devil had set on the Mithraists to
imitate in this and other respects the Church of Christ<a id='r877'></a><a href='#f877' class='c008'><sup>[877]</sup></a>. The
final scene of all comes when we see Mithras arresting the
glorious chariot of the Sun-God drawn by four white horses, and,
mounting therein, being driven off by the ray-crowned Helios
himself to the abode of light above the firmament<a id='r878'></a><a href='#f878' class='c008'><sup>[878]</sup></a>. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>also, it is easy to see a likeness between representations of the
Ascension of Mithras and that of Elijah or even of Christ<a id='r879'></a><a href='#f879' class='c008'><sup>[879]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>However this may be, the Legend of Mithras, as thus
portrayed, shows with fair closeness the belief of his worshippers
as to his place in the scheme of the universe. Mithras was
certainly not the Supreme God, a rank in the system filled by
Ahura Mazda, or his Latin counterpart, Jupiter Best and
Greatest<a id='r880'></a><a href='#f880' class='c008'><sup>[880]</sup></a>. But this being, like the Platonic Zeus and the
Gnostic Bythos, was considered too great and too remote to
concern himself with the doings of the visible universe, in which
Mithras acts as his vicegerent. Whether Mithras was or was
not considered as in some sort the double or antitype of the
Supreme Being cannot be said; but it is worth noticing that
in the Vedas, as among the Hittites, Varuna and Mitra form
an inseparable couple who are always invoked together, and
that the same seems to have been the case with Ahura Mazda
and Mithra in the oldest religious literature of the Persians<a id='r881'></a><a href='#f881' class='c008'><sup>[881]</sup></a>.
It may therefore well be that the learned doctors of the Mithraic
theology regarded their Supreme Being and Mithras as two
aspects of the same god, an idea that, as we have seen, was
current at about the same period among the Gnostics. It is,
however, impossible to speak with certainty on such a point
in the absence of any writings by persons professing the Mithraic
faith, and it is highly improbable that the rugged soldiers who
formed the majority of the god’s worshippers ever troubled
themselves much about such questions. For them, no doubt,
and for all, perhaps, but a few carefully-chosen persons,
Mithras was the Demiurge or Divine Artizan of the universe<a id='r882'></a><a href='#f882' class='c008'><sup>[882]</sup></a>,
which he governs in accordance with the laws of right and
justice, protecting and defending alike man and those animals
and plants useful to him which Mithras has himself created from
his own spontaneous goodness. Hence he was the only god
to whom they admitted allegiance, and although the existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of other heavenly beings was not denied, it is probable that
most of them were looked upon as occupying at the best a
position less important to us than that of Mithras himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable, moreover, that all the scenes in the Mithraic
sculptures in which we have seen the god taking part were
considered as being enacted before the creation of man and in
some heaven or world midway between the abode of Infinite
Light and this earth. That the grotto into which Mithras
drags the primordial Bull is no earthly cavern is plain from
Porphyry’s remark that the Mithraic cave was an image of the
universe<a id='r883'></a><a href='#f883' class='c008'><sup>[883]</sup></a>, as well as from the band of zodiacal figures or the
arch of rocks which sometimes encloses the bas-reliefs, the sky
being looked upon by the Babylonians as a rocky vault. The
sun and moon in their respective chariots also appear above
the principal scene; and a further hint as to its whereabouts
may be found in the fact that the flowing mantle of Mithras is
sometimes depicted as spangled with stars, thereby indicating
that the scenes in which he appears are supposed to take place
in the starry firmament. Hence is explained the epithet of
μεσίτης or Mediator, which Plutarch gives him<a id='r884'></a><a href='#f884' class='c008'><sup>[884]</sup></a>, and which
should be interpreted not as intercessor but as he who occupies
a position midway between two places<a id='r885'></a><a href='#f885' class='c008'><sup>[885]</sup></a>. That the higher of
these in this case was the Garôtman or abode of Infinite Light
of the Avestic literature, there can, it would seem, be no
question; but what was the lower?</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the statement must be guarded with all the
reserves imposed upon us in all matters relating to the religion
of Mithras by the absence of written documents, it is probable
that this lower division of the universe was our earth. The
monuments give us with fair certainty the Mithraic ideas as to
how life was brought thither; but they tell us little or nothing
as to the condition in which the earth was at the time, nor
how it was supposed to have come into existence. Porphyry
tells us that the “elements” (στοιχεῖα) were represented in the
Mithraic chapel<a id='r886'></a><a href='#f886' class='c008'><sup>[886]</sup></a>, and we find in some examples of the bull-slaying
scenes, the figures of a small lion and a crater or
mixing-bowl beneath the belly of the bull, which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>considers to be the symbols of fire and water respectively;
while the earth may be typified, as has been said above, by
the serpent, and the fourth element or air may be indicated by
the wind which is blowing Mithras’ mantle away from his body
and to the left of the group<a id='r887'></a><a href='#f887' class='c008'><sup>[887]</sup></a>. If this be so, it is probable that
the Mithraist who thought about such matters looked upon the
four elements, of which the ancients believed the world to be
composed, as already in existence before the sacrifice of the
primordial bull brought life upon the earth; and that the work
of Mithras as Demiurge or Artizan was confined to arranging
and moulding them into the form of the cosmos or ordered
world. As to what was the ultimate origin of these elements,
and whether the Mithraists, like the Gnostics, held that Matter
had an existence independent of, and a nature opposed to,
the Supreme Being, we have no indication whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of Mithraic eschatology or the view that the worshippers
of Mithras held as to the end of the world, we know rather less
than we do of their ideas as to its beginning. The Persian
religion, after its reform under the Sassanid kings, taught that
it would be consumed by fire<a id='r888'></a><a href='#f888' class='c008'><sup>[888]</sup></a>; and, as this doctrine of the
Ecpyrosis, as the ancients called it, was also held by the Stoics,
whose physical doctrines were then fashionable at Rome, it is
probable enough that it entered into Mithraism also. But of
this there is no proof, and <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s attempt to show that
a similar conflagration was thought by the Mithraic priests to
have taken place before the Tauroctony, and as a kind of
paradigm or forecast of what was to come, is not very convincing<a id='r889'></a><a href='#f889' class='c008'><sup>[889]</sup></a>.
Yet some glimpse of what was supposed to happen
between the creation of the world and its destruction seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>be typified by a monstrous figure often found in the ruined
chapels once used for the Mithraic worship, where it seems to
have been carefully guarded from the eyes of the general body
of worshippers. This monster had the body of a man<a id='r890'></a><a href='#f890' class='c008'><sup>[890]</sup></a> with
the head of a lion, while round his body is twined a huge
serpent, whose head either appears on the top of the lion’s or
rests on the human breast. On the monster’s back appear
sometimes two, but generally four wings, and in his hands he
bears upright two large keys, for one of which a sceptre is
sometimes substituted; while his feet are sometimes human,
sometimes those of a crocodile or other reptile. On his body,
between the folds of the serpent, there sometimes appear the
signs of the four quarters of the year, <i>i.e.</i> Aries and Libra,
Cancer and Capricorn<a id='r891'></a><a href='#f891' class='c008'><sup>[891]</sup></a>, and in other examples a thunderbolt on
the breast or on the right knee<a id='r892'></a><a href='#f892' class='c008'><sup>[892]</sup></a>. The figure is often mounted
on a globe which bears in one instance the two crossed bands
which show that it is intended for our earth, and in one curious
instance he appears to bear a flaming torch in each hand,
while his breath is kindling a flame which is seen rising from an
altar beside him<a id='r893'></a><a href='#f893' class='c008'><sup>[893]</sup></a>. It is possible that in this last we have a
symbolical representation of the Ecpyrosis. Lastly, in the
Mithraic chapel at Heddernheim, which is the only one where the
figure of the lion-headed monster was found <i>in situ</i>, it was concealed
within a deep niche or cell so fashioned, says <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont,
that the statue could only be perceived through a little conical
aperture or peep-hole made in the slab of basalt closing the niche<a id='r894'></a><a href='#f894' class='c008'><sup>[894]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s theory, as given in his magnificent work on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the <i>Mystères de Mithra</i> and elsewhere, is that the figure represents
that Zervan Akerene or Boundless Time whom he would
put at the head of the Mithraic pantheon, and would make the
father of both Ormuzd and Ahriman<a id='r895'></a><a href='#f895' class='c008'><sup>[895]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s opinion,
on a subject of which he has made himself the master, must
always command every respect, and it may be admitted that the
notion of such a supreme Being, corresponding in many ways
to the Ineffable Bythos of the Gnostics, did appear in the
later developments of the Persian religion, and may even have
been known during the time that the worship of Mithras
flourished in the West<a id='r896'></a><a href='#f896' class='c008'><sup>[896]</sup></a>. It has been shown elsewhere, however,
that this idea only came to the front long after the cult of
Mithras had become extinct, that <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s view that the
lion-headed monster was represented as without sex or passions
has been shown to be baseless by later discoveries, and that the
figure is connected in at least one example with an inscription
to Arimanes or Ahriman<a id='r897'></a><a href='#f897' class='c008'><sup>[897]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has himself noted the
confusion which a Christian, writing before the abolition of the
Mithras worship, makes between the statues of Hecate, goddess
of hell and patroness of sorcerers, and those of the lion-headed
monster<a id='r898'></a><a href='#f898' class='c008'><sup>[898]</sup></a>, and Hecate’s epithet of Περσείη can only be explained
by some similar association<a id='r899'></a><a href='#f899' class='c008'><sup>[899]</sup></a>. At the same time, <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont
makes it plain that the Mithraists did not regard these infernal
powers Ahriman and Hecate with the horror and loathing which
the reformed Zoroastrian religion afterwards heaped upon the
antagonist of Ormuzd<a id='r900'></a><a href='#f900' class='c008'><sup>[900]</sup></a>. On the contrary the dedications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>several altars and statues show that they paid them worship
and offered them sacrifices, as the Greeks did to Hades and
Persephone, the lord and lady of hell, of whom the Mithraists
probably considered them the Persian equivalents. From all
these facts, the conclusion seems inevitable that the lion-headed
monster represents Ahriman, the consort of Hecate<a id='r901'></a><a href='#f901' class='c008'><sup>[901]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we now look at the religious literature of the time when
the worship of Mithras was coming into favour, we find a pretty
general consensus of opinion that the chthonian or infernal
god represented in the earlier Persian religion by this Ahriman,
was a power who might be the rival of, but was not necessarily
the mortal enemy of Zeus. Whether Neander be right or not
in asserting that the prevailing tendency of the age was towards
Dualism<a id='r902'></a><a href='#f902' class='c008'><sup>[902]</sup></a>, it is certain that most civilized nations had then come
to the conclusion that on this earth the bad is always mixed up
with the good. Plutarch puts this clearly enough when he says
that nature here below comes not from one, but from two
opposed principles and contending powers, and this opinion, he
tells us, is a most ancient one which has come down from
expounders of myths (θεολόγοι) and legislators to poets and
philosophers, and is expressed “not in words and phrases, but
in mysteries and sacrifices, and has been found in many places
among both Barbarians and Greeks<a id='r903'></a><a href='#f903' class='c008'><sup>[903]</sup></a>.” The same idea of antagonistic
powers is, of course, put in a much stronger form in
the reformed Persian religion, where the incursion of Ahriman
into the kingdom of Ormuzd brings upon the earth all evil in
the shape of winter, prolonged drought, storms, disease, and
beasts and plants hurtful to man<a id='r904'></a><a href='#f904' class='c008'><sup>[904]</sup></a>. But this does not seem to
have been the view of Ahriman’s functions taken by the older
Magism, whence the worship of Mithras was probably derived<a id='r905'></a><a href='#f905' class='c008'><sup>[905]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In Mithraism, it is not Ahriman, as in the <i>Bundahish</i>, but
Mithras, the vicegerent of Ormuzd, who slays the mystic Bull,
and by so doing he brings good and not evil to the earth.
Nowhere do we find in the Mithraic sculptures any allusion to
Ahriman as a god of evil pure and simple, or as one who is for
ever opposed to the heavenly powers. We do, indeed, find in
several Mithraea representations of a Titanomachia where the
Titans, represented as men with serpent legs, are depicted as
fleeing before a god like the Greek Zeus who strikes them with
his thunderbolts<a id='r906'></a><a href='#f906' class='c008'><sup>[906]</sup></a>. But this is not more necessarily suggestive
of two irreconcilable principles than the Greek story of the
Titans, those sons of Earth who were persuaded by their mother
to make war upon their father Uranos, who put their brother
Kronos upon his throne, and who were in their turn hurled from
heaven by Kronos’ son Zeus. Even if we do not accept the later
myth which reconciles Zeus to his adversaries<a id='r907'></a><a href='#f907' class='c008'><sup>[907]</sup></a>, the story does
not go further than to say that the Titans attempted to gain
heaven and were thrust back to their own proper dwelling-place,
the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in this way, as it would seem, that the lion-headed
monster of the Mithraic chapels must be explained. Ahriman,
the god girt with the serpent which represents the earth, has
rebelled against Ormuzd or Jupiter, and has been marked with
the thunderbolt which has cast him down from heaven. But
he remains none the less lord of his own domain, the earth, his
sway over which is shown by the sceptre which he wields while
standing upon it<a id='r908'></a><a href='#f908' class='c008'><sup>[908]</sup></a>. As for the keys which he bears, they are
doubtless those of the gates behind which he keeps the souls
and bodies of men, as the Orphics said, imprisoned, until he
is compelled to release them by a higher power<a id='r909'></a><a href='#f909' class='c008'><sup>[909]</sup></a>. In all this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>his functions do not go beyond those of the Greek Hades, with
whom Plutarch equates him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is however, possible that he was conceived by the Mithraists
as occupying a slightly different place in the material
universe from that of his Greek prototype. The true realm of
Hades was generally placed by the Greeks below the earth, but
that of the Mithraic Ahriman may possibly be just outside it.
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont shows many reasons for supposing the lion-headed
god to be connected with the idea of destiny<a id='r910'></a><a href='#f910' class='c008'><sup>[910]</sup></a>, and in one of the
very few contemporary writings which make distinct allusion
to the Mithraic tenets, there is something which confirms this
view. This occurs in a fragment embedded, as it were, in a
Magic Papyrus or sorcerer’s handbook now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris<a id='r911'></a><a href='#f911' class='c008'><sup>[911]</sup></a>. The document itself is probably not, as
Prof. Albert Dieterich has too boldly asserted, a “Mithraic
Liturgy”; but it is evidently connected in some way with the
Mithraic worship and begins with a statement that the writer
is a priest who has received inspiration from “the great Sun-God
Mithras.” <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Georges Lafaye is of opinion that it narrates
in apocalyptic fashion the adventures of the soul of a perfect
Mithraist on its way to heaven, and this is probably correct,
although it is here told for no purpose of edification but as a
spell or charm<a id='r912'></a><a href='#f912' class='c008'><sup>[912]</sup></a>. The soul, if it be indeed she who is speaking,
repeatedly complains to the gods whom she meets—including
one in white tunic, crimson mantle and anaxyrides or Persian
trousers who may be Mithras himself—of “the harsh and
inexorable necessity” which has been compelling her so long
as she remained in the “lower nature<a id='r913'></a><a href='#f913' class='c008'><sup>[913]</sup></a>.” But the Sphere of
Destiny or necessity, as we have seen in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, was
thought to be the one immediately surrounding the earth, and
although the document in which we have before met with this
idea belongs to a different set of religious beliefs than those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>here treated of, it is probable that both Gnostic and Mithraist
drew it from the astrological theories current at the time which
came into the Hellenistic world from Babylon. It is therefore
extremely probable that the Mithraists figured Ahriman as
ruling the earth from the sphere immediately outside it, and
this would agree well with his position <i>upon</i> the globe in the
monuments where he appears. It is some confirmation of this
that, in another part of the Papyrus just quoted, the “World-ruler”
(Cosmocrator) is invoked as “the Great Serpent, leader
of these gods, who holds the source of Egypt [<abbr class='spell'>Qy</abbr>, The Nile?]
and the end of the whole inhabited world [in his hands], who
begets in Ocean Pshoi (<i>i.e.</i> Fate) the god of gods<a id='r914'></a><a href='#f914' class='c008'><sup>[914]</sup></a>”; while
the Great Dragon or Outer Darkness in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> is
said to surround the earth. That both orthodox Christians
and Gnostics like the Valentinians looked upon the Devil, who,
as lord of hell, was sometimes identified with Hades, as the
Cosmocrator or World-Ruler requires no further demonstration<a id='r915'></a><a href='#f915' class='c008'><sup>[915]</sup></a>,
and in this particular as in others the Mithraists may have
drawn from the same source as the Gnostic teachers<a id='r916'></a><a href='#f916' class='c008'><sup>[916]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>That they did so in a related matter can be shown by direct
evidence. Like the Ophites of the Diagram before described,
the Mithraists thought that the soul descended to the body
through seven spheres which were those of the “planets”
Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, the Moon, and the Sun
in that order, which Origen, who mentions the fact, says that
the Persian theology declared to be symbolized “by the names
of the rest of matter,” and also gave for it “musical reasons<a id='r917'></a><a href='#f917' class='c008'><sup>[917]</sup></a>.”
He further describes the different qualities which the soul in
her passage receives from each sphere, and which it seems fair
to conclude she gives back to them on her reascension.
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont is no doubt right when he attributes the origin of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>this tenet to the <i>mathematici</i> or astrologers and says that it too
came originally from Chaldaea<a id='r918'></a><a href='#f918' class='c008'><sup>[918]</sup></a>. The seven heavens are also
found in many Oriental documents of the time, including the
<i>Book of the Secrets of Enoch</i><a id='r919'></a><a href='#f919' class='c008'><sup>[919]</sup></a> and the <i>Apocalypse of Baruch</i><a id='r920'></a><a href='#f920' class='c008'><sup>[920]</sup></a>.
According to Origen, they were symbolized in the Mithraic
chapels by a ladder of eight steps, the first seven being of the
metals peculiar to the different planets, <i>i.e.</i> lead, tin, copper,
iron, an alloy of several metals, silver, and gold, with the eighth
step representing the heaven of the fixed stars<a id='r921'></a><a href='#f921' class='c008'><sup>[921]</sup></a>. The Stoics
who held similar views, following therein perhaps the Platonic
cosmogony, had already fixed the gate of the sky through which
the souls left the heaven of the fixed stars on their descent to
the earth in Cancer, and that by which they reascended in
Capricorn<a id='r922'></a><a href='#f922' class='c008'><sup>[922]</sup></a>, which probably accounts for the two keys borne by
the lion-headed god on the Mithraic monuments, and for those
two Zodiacal signs being displayed on his body. The other two
signs, <i>viz.</i> Aries and Libra, may possibly refer to the places in
a horoscope or genethliacal figure which the astrologers of the
time called the <span lang="la"><i>Porta laboris</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>Janua Ditis</i></span> respectively, as
denoting the gate by which man “born to labour” enters life,
and the “gate of Hades” by which he leaves it<a id='r923'></a><a href='#f923' class='c008'><sup>[923]</sup></a>. If, as
Porphyry says, the doctrine of metempsychosis formed part
of the Mithraic teaching, the keys would thus have a meaning
analogous to the Orphic release from “the wheel<a id='r924'></a><a href='#f924' class='c008'><sup>[924]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other gods who appear on the Mithraic monuments are
those known to us in classical mythology and are represented
under the usual human forms made familiar by Greek and
Roman art. By the side of, but in a subordinate position to
Jupiter, we find, if <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont be justified in his identifications,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>nearly all the “great gods” of the Greco-Roman pantheon.
Five of these, that is to say, Jupiter himself, Saturn, Mars,
Venus, and Mercury may be intended as symbols of the planets
which, then as now, bore these names. But there are others
such as Juno, Neptune and Amphitrite, Pluto and Proserpine,
Apollo, Vulcan, and Hercules who cannot by any possibility
be considered as planetary signs<a id='r925'></a><a href='#f925' class='c008'><sup>[925]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s theory about
these divinities is, if one understands him rightly, that these are
really Persian or Avestic gods, such as Verethragna, represented
under the classic forms of their Greek counterparts to make
them attractive to their Roman worshippers<a id='r926'></a><a href='#f926' class='c008'><sup>[926]</sup></a>. This does not
seem very probable, because the Persians did not figure their
gods in human form<a id='r927'></a><a href='#f927' class='c008'><sup>[927]</sup></a>. Nor is there any reason to think that
the Mithraists confined themselves to the <i>theocrasia</i> or the
practice of discovering their own gods in the divinities of the
peoples around them which we have seen so rife in Greece, Italy,
and Egypt. But in the age when the worship of Mithras became
popular in the Roman Empire, all paganism was groping its way
towards a religion which should include and conciliate all others,
and there is much evidence that the votaries of Mithras were
especially determined that this religion should be their own. Isis,
as we have seen, might proclaim herself as the one divinity
whom under many names and in many forms the whole earth
adored; but the Mithraists apparently went further and tried
to show that their religion contained within itself all the rest.
They appear to have first gained access to Rome under an alliance
with the priests of Cybele, whose image, with its emasculated
attendants the Galli, was transported from Pergamum to the
Eternal City during the critical moments of the Second Punic
War<a id='r928'></a><a href='#f928' class='c008'><sup>[928]</sup></a>. Externally there were many analogies between the
two cults, and Cybele’s consort Attis, like Mithras, was always
represented in a Phrygian cap and anaxyrides. One of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>impressive, if most disgusting practices in the religion of Cybele—the
Taurobolium or blood-bath in which a bull was slaughtered
over a pit covered with planks pierced with holes through which
the blood of the victim dripped upon the naked votary below—was
borrowed by the Mithraists, and many of them boast on
their funereal inscriptions that they have undergone this ceremony
and thereby, as they express it, have been “born again.”
The <i>clarissimi</i> and high officials of the Empire who have left
records of the kind are careful to note that they are worshippers
of “the Great Mother” (Cybele) and Attis, as well as of Mithras<a id='r929'></a><a href='#f929' class='c008'><sup>[929]</sup></a>,
and a similar statement occurs so frequently on the funereal and
other inscriptions of their wives as to lead to the hypothesis that
the ceremonies of the Phrygian Goddess were the natural refuge
of Mithras’ female votaries<a id='r930'></a><a href='#f930' class='c008'><sup>[930]</sup></a>. So, too, the worship of the
Alexandrian divinities, which that of Mithras in some sort
supplanted, and which, as being as popular in the Greek world
as the last-named was in the Latin, might have been expected
to be hostile to it, yet had relations with it not very easy to be
understood. In the assembly of the gods which in some of the
monuments crowns the arch set over the Tauroctony, the
central place is in one instance taken by Sarapis with the
distinctive <i>modius</i> on his head instead of Zeus or Jupiter<a id='r931'></a><a href='#f931' class='c008'><sup>[931]</sup></a>, the
same priest often describes himself as serving the altars of both
gods, and “Zeus, Helios, Mithras, Sarapis, unconquered one!”
is invoked in one of those spells in the Magic Papyri which
contain fragments of ritual prayers or hymns<a id='r932'></a><a href='#f932' class='c008'><sup>[932]</sup></a>. Possibly it is
for this reason, that the initiating priest in Apuleius’ story whom
the grateful Lucius says he regards as his father, is named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Mithras, as if the initiate had been led to the Mysteries of Isis
through the worship of that god<a id='r933'></a><a href='#f933' class='c008'><sup>[933]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same syncretistic tendency is particularly marked in the
leaning of the Mithraists to the worship of the gods of Eleusis.
“Consecrated to Liber [the Latin name of Dionysos] and the
Eleusinian [goddesses],” “Mystes of Ceres,” “priest” or “Chief
Herdsman (<i>archibucolus</i>) of the god Liber,” “hierophant of
Father Liber and the Hecates,” “Consecrated at Eleusis to
the god Bacchus, Ceres, and Cora” are some of the distinctions
which the devotees of Mithras vaunt on their tombstones<a id='r934'></a><a href='#f934' class='c008'><sup>[934]</sup></a>;
while we learn that when the last survivors of the two sacred
families who had for centuries furnished priests to the Eleusinian
Mysteries died out, the Athenians sent for a priest of
Mithras from one of the neighbouring islands, and handed over
to him the care of the sacred rites<a id='r935'></a><a href='#f935' class='c008'><sup>[935]</sup></a>. It is even possible that
the complaisance of the Mithraists for other religions went
further than has hitherto been suspected. Not only does Justin
Martyr after describing the celebration of the Christian Eucharist
say,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wherefore also the evil demons in mimicry have handed down
that the same thing should be done in the Mysteries of Mithras.
For that bread and a cup of water are in these mysteries set before
the initiate with certain speeches you either know or can learn<a id='r936'></a><a href='#f936' class='c008'><sup>[936]</sup></a>”;</p>

<p class='c010'>but we know from Porphyry that the initiate into the rites of
Mithras underwent a baptism by total immersion which was
said to expiate his sins<a id='r937'></a><a href='#f937' class='c008'><sup>[937]</sup></a>. Among the worshippers of Mithras, on
the same authority, were also virgins and others vowed to
continence<a id='r938'></a><a href='#f938' class='c008'><sup>[938]</sup></a>, and we hear that the Mithraists used, like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Christians, to call each other “Brother” and address their
priests as “Father<a id='r939'></a><a href='#f939' class='c008'><sup>[939]</sup></a>.” <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine tells us that in his time
the priests of Mithras were in the habit of saying, “That One
in the Cap [<i>i.e.</i> Mithras] is a Christian too!” and it is not
unlikely that the claim was seriously made<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c008'><sup>[940]</sup></a>. During the reigns
of the Second Flavian Emperors and before Constantine’s pact
with the Church, we hear of hymns sung by the legionaries
which could be chanted in common by Christians, Mithraists,
and the worshippers of that Sun-God the adoration of whom
was hereditary or traditional in the Flavian House<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c008'><sup>[941]</sup></a>. The
Mithraists also observed Sunday and kept sacred the <abbr title='twenty-fifth'>25th</abbr> of
December as the birthday of the sun<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c008'><sup>[942]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other rites and ceremonies used in the worship of
Mithras we know next to nothing. As appears from the authors
last quoted, the whole of the worship was conducted in
“mysteries” or secret ceremonies like the Eleusinian and the
rites of the Alexandrian divinities, although on a more extended
scale. The Mithraic mysteries always took place in a subterranean
vault or “cave,” lighted only by artificial light. The
ruins of many of these have been found, and are generally so
small as to be able to accommodate only a few worshippers<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c008'><sup>[943]</sup></a>,
whence perhaps it followed that there were often several
Mithraea in the same town or city<a id='r944'></a><a href='#f944' class='c008'><sup>[944]</sup></a>. The chief feature seems to
have been always the scene of the Tauroctony or Bull-slaying
which was displayed on the apse or further end of the chapel,
and was generally carved in bas-relief although occasionally
rendered in the round. The effect of this was sought to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>heightened by brilliant colouring, perhaps made necessary by
the dim light, and there were certainly altars of the square or
triangular pedestal type, and a well or other source from which
water could be obtained. The benches for the worshippers
were of stone and ran at right angles to and on either side of
the Tauroctony, so as to resemble the choir stalls in the chancel
of a modern church<a id='r945'></a><a href='#f945' class='c008'><sup>[945]</sup></a>. We have seen that the lion-headed
figure was concealed from the eyes of the worshippers, and we
know that they used to kneel during at least part of the service,
which was not in accord with the practice of either the Greeks
or Romans, who were accustomed to stand with upturned palms
when praying to the gods<a id='r946'></a><a href='#f946' class='c008'><sup>[946]</sup></a>. Sacrifices of animals which, if we
may judge from the débris left in some of the chapels, were
generally birds<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c008'><sup>[947]</sup></a>, seem to have been made; but there is no
reason to believe the accusation sometimes brought against the
Mithraists that they also slaughtered human victims in honour
of their god. Lampridius tells us, on the other hand, that the
Emperor Commodus on his initiation sullied the temple by
converting a feigned into a real murder<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c008'><sup>[948]</sup></a>, and we hear from
another and later source that in consequence of this only a
bloody sword was shown to the candidate<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c008'><sup>[949]</sup></a>. It seems therefore
that somebody was supposed to suffer death during the ceremony,
perhaps under the same circumstances as already
suggested in the kindred case of the Alexandrian Mysteries<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c008'><sup>[950]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are a little better informed as to the degrees of initiation,
which numbered seven. The initiate ascended from the degree
of Crow (<i>corax</i>), which was the first or lowest, to that of Father
(<i>Pater</i>), which was the seventh or highest, by passing successively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>through the intermediate degrees of Man of the Secret (<i>Cryphius</i>),
Soldier (<i>Miles</i>), Lion (<i>Leo</i>), Persian (<i>Perses</i>), and Courier of
the Sun (<i>Heliodromus</i>)<a id='r951'></a><a href='#f951' class='c008'><sup>[951]</sup></a>. It would seem that either he, or the
initiating priests, or perhaps the other assistants, had to assume
disguises consisting of masks corresponding to the animals
named in the first and fourth of these degrees, and to make
noises like the croaking of birds and the roaring of lions<a id='r952'></a><a href='#f952' class='c008'><sup>[952]</sup></a>. These
rightly recall to <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont the names of animals borne by
initiates or priests in other religions in Greece and Asia Minor
and may be referred to totemistic times. We also know from
a chance allusion of Tertullian that on being admitted to the
degree of soldier, the initiate was offered a crown or garland at
the point of a sword, which he put away from him with the
speech, “Mithras is my crown!”, and that never thereafter
might he wear a garland even at a feast<a id='r953'></a><a href='#f953' class='c008'><sup>[953]</sup></a>. Porphyry, too, tells
us that in the degree of Lion, the initiate’s hands and lips were
purified with honey. It has also been said by the Fathers that
before or during initiation, the candidate had to undergo certain
trials or tortures, to swim rivers, plunge through fire, and to
jump from apparently vast heights<a id='r954'></a><a href='#f954' class='c008'><sup>[954]</sup></a>; but it is evident from the
small size of the Mithraea or chapels which have come down to
us that these experiences would have demanded much more
elaborate preparation than there was space for, and, if they
were ever enacted, were probably as purely “make-believe”
as the supposed murder just mentioned and some of the
initiatory ceremonies in certain societies of the present day<a id='r955'></a><a href='#f955' class='c008'><sup>[955]</sup></a>.
Lastly, there is no doubt that women were strictly excluded
from all the ceremonies of the cult, thereby justifying in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>sort the remark of Renan that Mithraism was a “Pagan
Freemasonry<a id='r956'></a><a href='#f956' class='c008'><sup>[956]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has also been said that the true inwardness and faith of
the religion of Mithras was in these mysteries only gradually
and with great caution revealed to the initiates, whose fitness
for them was tested at every step<a id='r957'></a><a href='#f957' class='c008'><sup>[957]</sup></a>. It may be so, but it is
plain that the Mithraist was informed at the outset of at least
a good many of the tenets of the faith. The whole Legend of
Mithras, so far as we know it, must have been known to the
initiate soon after entering the Mithraic chapel, since we have
ourselves gathered it mainly from the different scenes depicted
on the borders of the great central group of the Tauroctony.
So, too, the mystic banquet or Mithraic Sacrament which, if
the Heddernheim monuments stood alone, we might consider
was concealed from the eyes of the lower initiates until the
proper moment came, also forms one of the subsidiary scenes
of the great altar piece in the chapels at Sarmizegetusa, Bononia
and many other places<a id='r958'></a><a href='#f958' class='c008'><sup>[958]</sup></a>. In a bas-relief at Sarrebourg, moreover,
the two principal persons at the banquet, <i>i.e.</i> Mithras and
the Sun, are shown surrounded by other figures wearing the
masks of crows and perhaps lions<a id='r959'></a><a href='#f959' class='c008'><sup>[959]</sup></a>, which looks as if initiates of
all grades were admitted to the sacramental banquet. One
can therefore make no profitable conjecture as to what particular
doctrines were taught in the particular degrees, though there
seems much likelihood in <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s statement that the
initiates were thought to take rank in the next world according
to the degree that they had received in this<a id='r960'></a><a href='#f960' class='c008'><sup>[960]</sup></a>. The belief that
“those who have received humble mysteries shall have humble
places and those that have received exalted mysteries exalted
places” in the next world was, we may be sure, too profitable
a one for the priests of Mithras to be neglected by them. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>certainly explains the extraordinary order for the planetary
spheres adopted by Origen<a id='r961'></a><a href='#f961' class='c008'><sup>[961]</sup></a>, according to which the souls which
had taken the lowest degree would go to the heaven of Saturn,
slowest and most unlucky of the planets, while those perfected
in the faith would enter the glorious house of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether they were thought to go further still, we can only
guess. It should be noticed that the mystic ladder of Mithras
had <i>eight</i> steps, and we have seen that when the soul had
climbed through the seven planetary spheres there was still
before her the heaven of the fixed stars. The Sun seems in
Origen’s account of the Mithraic faith to have formed the last
world to be traversed before this highest heaven could be
reached; and it was through the disk of the Sun that the
ancients thought the gods descended to and reascended from
the earth. This idea appears plainly in the Papyrus quoted
above, where the Mithraist is represented as an eagle who flies
upwards “and alone” to heaven and there beholds all things<a id='r962'></a><a href='#f962' class='c008'><sup>[962]</sup></a>.
He prays that he may, in spite of his mortal and corruptible
nature, behold with immortal eyes after having been hallowed
with holy hallowings, “the deathless aeon, lord of the fiery
crowns,” and that “the corruptible nature of mortals” which
has been imposed upon him by “inexorable Necessity” may
depart from him. “Then,” says the author of the fragment—which,
it will be remembered, claims to be a revelation given by
the archangel of the great Sun-God Mithras—the initiate “will
see the gods who rule each day and hour ascending to heaven
and others descending, and the path of the visible gods through
the disk of the god my father will appear.” He describes the
machinery of nature by which the winds are produced, which
seems to be figured on some of the Mithraic monuments, and
which reminds one of the physics supposed to be revealed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the Enochian literature. Then, after certain spells have been
recited, the initiate sees the disk of the Sun, which opens,
disclosing “doors of fire and the world of the gods within them.”
Then follow more invocations to the gods of the seven planetary
worlds who appear in due course, and presumably give him
admission to their realms. After another invocation, in what
may possibly be some Asianic or Anatolian language very much
corrupted, the initiate beholds “a young god, beautiful, with
fiery hair, in white tunic and purple mantle, and having on his
head a crown of fire,” who seems to be Helios or Sol, the driver
of the sun’s chariot on the Mithraic monuments. He is saluted
as “Mighty in strength, mighty ruler, greatest king of gods!
O Sun, lord of heaven and earth, God of Gods!” Next appear
“seven virgins in linen robes having the heads of serpents,”
who are called “the seven Fortunes of heaven” and are, as
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Georges Lafaye surmises, the seven stars of the constellation
of the Great Bear<a id='r963'></a><a href='#f963' class='c008'><sup>[963]</sup></a>. They are followed by seven male gods also
dressed in linen robes and with golden crowns, but equipped
with the heads of black bulls, who are called “the rulers of
the Pole.” These are they, we are told, who send upon the
impious thunders and lightnings and earthquakes. And so we
are led at last to the apparition of “a god of extraordinary
stature, having a glance of fire, young and golden-haired, in
white tunic and golden crown, clothed in anaxyrides, holding in
his right hand the golden shoulder of a young bull.” This,
<i>i.e.</i> the shoulder, we are told, is called “Arctos, who moves the
sky, making it to turn forwards and backwards according to
the hour.” But the god appears to be intended for Mithras,
and the shoulder of the bull is probably an allusion to the bull-slaying
scene which may serve to show that there were more
interpretations than one placed upon the Tauroctony. The
initiate hails this god as “Lord of water, consecrator of the
earth, ruler of the air, shining-rayed One, of primeval rays!”
and the like, and continues:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lord, having been born again, I die! Having increased and
again increasing, I come to an end by life-begotten birth, and
coming into existence, and having been released unto death, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>pursue my way, as thou hast ordered from the beginning, as thou
hast ordained: And having accomplished the mystery, I am
<i>Pheroura miouri</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the fragment abruptly breaks off, and plunges into directions
for the manufacture of oracles and the other stuff common
in Magic Papyri. One is not much inclined to believe with
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont that the author of the galimatias knew nothing
about Mithraism<a id='r964'></a><a href='#f964' class='c008'><sup>[964]</sup></a>, and merely introduced Mithras’ name into
his opening to impress his readers with a sense of the value of
his recipes. It seems more likely that the writer of the fragment
had really got hold of some part of a Mithraic ritual,
which he had read without understanding it, and that he was
trying to work more or less meaningless extracts from it into
his spells on the same principle that the sorcerers of the
European Renaissance used when they took similar liberties
with the words of the Mass. If this view be adopted, it follows
that the concluding words given above confirm the view that
the Mithraists, like the Orphics before them, taught the metempsychosis
or reincarnation of souls<a id='r965'></a><a href='#f965' class='c008'><sup>[965]</sup></a>. Did the Mithraist think
that his soul, when released from this “dread necessity,” finally
escaped from even the planetary spheres and, raising itself into
the heaven of the fixed stars, became united with the Deity
Himself? We can only ask the question without being able
to suggest an answer supported by any evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the priests who acted as celebrants in these
strange mysteries, there are instances to be found in the inscriptions
which make it plain that the priestly office was not
confined or attached to any particular degree of initiation.
<i>Pater Patrum</i> (Father of Fathers) is a designation which occurs
too frequently on the monuments for it to mean anything but
eldest or president of those who had taken the seventh or
highest degree in one congregation<a id='r966'></a><a href='#f966' class='c008'><sup>[966]</sup></a>. But <i>Sacerdos</i> or <i>Antistes</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>indifferently is the name by which the priest of Mithras is
described by himself and others, and the holding of the office
seems not to have been inconsistent with the tenure at once
of other priesthoods and of high office in the State. Thus
the <i>clarissimus</i> Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, who was Urban
Praetor, Proconsul of Achaea, Prefect of the City, Prefect of
the Praetorians of Italy and Illyricum, and Consul Designate
at the time of his death, was Father of Fathers in the religion
of Mithras besides being Pontiff of the Sun and Pontiff of Vesta<a id='r967'></a><a href='#f967' class='c008'><sup>[967]</sup></a>.
This was at a very late date, when probably only a man of high
civil rank dared avow on his tombstone, as did Vettius, his
fidelity to the god; but earlier, we find Lucius Septimius, a
freedman of Severus, Caracalla, and Geta, acting as “Father
and Priest of the Unconquered Mithras in the Augustan house”—evidently
a Court chaplain—, and a certain <i>clarissimus</i> Alfenius
Julianus Kamenius who is of consular rank, a quaestor and a
praetor, as a “father of the sacred things of the Highest Unconquered
One Mithras<a id='r968'></a><a href='#f968' class='c008'><sup>[968]</sup></a>.” So, too, we find a veteran of the
IVth Flavian Legion acting as <i>pater sacrorum</i>, a decurion as
<i>antistes</i> and another as <i>sacerdos</i> of Mithras<a id='r969'></a><a href='#f969' class='c008'><sup>[969]</sup></a>. Evidently, the
cares of the priesthood did not occupy the priest’s whole time,
and he never seems to have lived in the temple as did the clergy
of the Alexandrian divinities. There was, on the faith of
Porphyry, a <i>summus pontifex</i> or Supreme Pontiff of Mithras,
who like the Christian bishop in the Epistle to Timothy was
forbidden to marry more than once<a id='r970'></a><a href='#f970' class='c008'><sup>[970]</sup></a>; but this was probably
a high officer of State appointed directly by the Emperor.
No proof is forthcoming that a fire was kept perpetually burning
on the altar in the European chapels of Mithras, as perhaps was
the case with the temples of the faith in Asia Minor, or that
daily or any other regularly repeated services were held there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and such services moreover could seldom have been attended
by the soldiers with the colours, who seem to have made up
the majority of the god’s worshippers. Prayers to the Sun-God
and other deities were no doubt offered by Mithraists, possibly
at sunrise and sunset, and perhaps special ones on the first day
of the week, which they very likely held sacred to their god.
But the small size of the Mithraea, and the scanty number of
the members of the associations supporting each<a id='r971'></a><a href='#f971' class='c008'><sup>[971]</sup></a>, make it
extremely unlikely that there was anything like regular congregational
worship, or that the faithful assembled there except
for initiations or meetings for conferring the different degrees.
The extremely poor execution of the bas-reliefs and other
sculptures found in the majority of these chapels all points the
same way. Most of these, together with the furniture and what
are nowadays called “articles de culte,” were presented to the
chapel by private members of the association<a id='r972'></a><a href='#f972' class='c008'><sup>[972]</sup></a>. The fact that
the congregations of many chapels must have frequently
changed by the shifting of garrisons from one end of the Empire
to the other caused by the operations of war both external and
civil, also helps to account for their temporary and poverty-stricken
appearance when compared with the great and stately
temples reared to rival gods like Serapis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the truth of Renan’s comparison of the Mithraic faith
with modern Freemasonry becomes more apparent, and we
may picture to ourselves the Mithraists as a vast society spread
over the whole of the Empire, consisting mainly of soldiers,
and entirely confined to the male sex. The example of the
Emperor Julian, himself a devotee of Mithras, but actively
concerned in the propagation of the worship of other divinities,
such as Apollo, Serapis, Mars, and Cybele<a id='r973'></a><a href='#f973' class='c008'><sup>[973]</sup></a>, shows that its real
aim was not so much the conversion of individuals as the inclusion
of all other cults within itself. It was doubtless with this
view that Julian recalled from exile those heresiarchs who had
been banished by the Christian emperors and insisted on equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>toleration for all sects of Jews and Christians<a id='r974'></a><a href='#f974' class='c008'><sup>[974]</sup></a>. Themistius is
no doubt merely echoing the sentiments of the Mithraist
emperor when he writes to his Christian successor Jovian that
no lover of wisdom should bind himself to any exclusively
national worship, but should acquaint himself with all religions<a id='r975'></a><a href='#f975' class='c008'><sup>[975]</sup></a>.
God, he says, requires no agreement on this subject
among men, and their rivalries in matters of faith are really
beneficial in leading their minds to the contemplation of other
than worldly things. But this highly philosophic temper was
not reached all at once; and it is probable that the worship of
Mithras was, on its first importation into the West, but one
foreign superstition the more, as little enlightened and as
exclusively national as the Jewish, the Egyptian, or any of the
others. It was probably its rise to imperial favour under the
Antonines, when Commodus and many of the freedmen of
Caesar’s House were initiated, that first suggested to its votaries
the possibility of using it as an instrument of government;
and henceforth its fortunes were bound up with those of
the still Pagan State. Its strictly monarchical doctrine, using
the adjective in its ancient rather than in its modern connotation,
must have always endeared it to the emperors, who were
beginning to see clearly that in a <i>quasi</i>-Oriental despotism lay
the only chance of salvation for the Roman Empire. Its relations
with Mazdeism in the strict form which this last assumed after
the religious reforms of the Sassanian Shahs have never been
elucidated, and <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont seems to rely too much upon the
later Avestic literature to explain everything that is obscure
in the religion of Mithras. If we imagine, as there is reason to
do, that Western Mithraism was looked upon by the Sassanian
reformers as a dangerous heresy<a id='r976'></a><a href='#f976' class='c008'><sup>[976]</sup></a>, the Roman Emperors would
have an additional reason for supporting it; and it is significant
that it was exactly those rulers whose wars against the Persians
were most successful who seem to have most favoured the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>worship of the Persian god. When Trajan conquered Dacia,
the great province between the Carpathians and the Danube
now represented by Hungary and Roumania, he colonized it
by a great mass of settlers from every part of the Roman Empire,
including therein many Orientals who brought with them into
their new home the worship of their Syrian and Asianic gods<a id='r977'></a><a href='#f977' class='c008'><sup>[977]</sup></a>.
It was hence an excellent field for the culture of a universal
and syncretic religion such as that of Mithras, and the great
number of Mithraea whose remains have been found in that
province, show that this religion must have received hearty
encouragement from the Imperial Court. From its geographical
position, Dacia formed an effective counterpoise to the growing
influence upon Roman policy of the Eastern provinces, and it
might have proved a valuable outpost for a religion which was
always looked upon with hostility by the Greek-speaking
subjects of Rome. Unfortunately, however, a religion which
allies itself with the State must suffer from its ally’s reverses
as well as profit by its good fortunes, and so the Mithraists
found. When the Gothic invasion desolated Dacia, and especially
when Valerian’s disaster enabled the Goths to gain a
footing there which not even the military genius of Claudius
could loosen, Mithraism received a blow which was ultimately
to prove fatal. The abandonment of Dacia to the Goths and
Vandals by Aurelian in 255 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, led to its replanting by a race
whose faces were turned more to Constantinople than to Rome,
and who were before long to be converted to Christianity <i>en
masse</i><a id='r978'></a><a href='#f978' class='c008'><sup>[978]</sup></a>. Diocletian and his colleagues did what they could to
restore the balance by proclaiming, as has been said above, the
“unconquered” Mithras the protector of their empire at the
great city which is now the capital of the Austrian Empire;
but the accession of Constantine and his alliance with the
Christian Church some twenty years later, definitely turned the
scale against the last god of Paganism. Although the Mithraic
worship may have revived for a moment under the philosophic
Julian, who was, as has been said, peculiarly addicted to it,
it possessed no real power of recuperation, and was perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>one of the first Pagan religions to be extinguished by the
triumphant Christians<a id='r979'></a><a href='#f979' class='c008'><sup>[979]</sup></a>. In 377 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, Gracchus, the Urban
Prefect of Rome, being desirous of baptism, carried into effect
a promise made, as <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Jerome boasts, some time before, and
breaking into a chapel of Mithras, “overturned, broke in pieces
and cast out” the sculptures which had seen the admission of
so many initiates<a id='r980'></a><a href='#f980' class='c008'><sup>[980]</sup></a>. His example was followed in other parts
of the Empire, and it is probable that some decree was obtained
from the Emperor Gratian legalizing these acts of vandalism<a id='r981'></a><a href='#f981' class='c008'><sup>[981]</sup></a>.
It is in this reign, <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont finds, that most of the Mithraea
were wrecked, and the very few which have come down to us
in more complete state owe their preservation to the caution of
their congregations, who blocked or built up the entrances to
them in the vain hope that a fresh turn of the wheel might
again bring their own cult to the top<a id='r982'></a><a href='#f982' class='c008'><sup>[982]</sup></a>. A conservative reaction
towards the older faiths did indeed come for a moment under
Eugenius; but it was then too late. The masses had turned
from Mithraism to Christianity, and the only adherents of the
“Capped One” were to be found among the senators and high
officials who had long connived at the evasion of the edicts
prohibiting all forms of Pagan worship. The invasions of
Alaric and Attila probably completed what the Christian mob
had begun.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont and Sir Samuel Dill are doubtless right when
they attribute the downfall of Mithraism in great measure to
its attitude towards women<a id='r983'></a><a href='#f983' class='c008'><sup>[983]</sup></a>. Mithraism was from the first
essentially a virile faith, and had little need of the softer
emotions. Hence we find in it none of the gorgeous public
ritual, the long hours spent in mystic contemplation before the
altar, or the filial devotion of the flock to the priest, that we
see in the worship of the Alexandrian Gods. In spite of the
great authority of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, whose statements on the subject
seem to have been accepted without much enquiry by later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>writers, it will probably appear to the impartial student that
the priests of Mithras were more like the churchwardens or
elders of Protestant communities at the present day than the
active and highly organized hierarchy of the Alexandrian
divinities and of the Catholic Church. It is, as we have seen,
most probable that they never visited their chapels except in
company with the other devotees when an initiation into one
or other of the seven degrees of the cult was to be performed,
and, judging from the scanty numbers of the congregation, this
can only have been at fairly long intervals. Hence the daily
prayers and sacrifices of themselves and their congregations
were probably rendered elsewhere, either in the privacy of their
homes, or in the temples of other gods. In neither case would
they have much need for the assistance of women in their
propaganda, who would, moreover, have probably felt little
interest in a worship from the most solemn and distinctive
parts of which they were excluded. The Mithraists therefore
had to dispense with the support of a very large and important
fraction of the community which was easily won over to the
side of their rivals. Exceptional causes such as the perpetual
shifting of the legions from one end of the Empire to the other
at a time when communications between them were many times
more difficult than now, may have prevented such considerations
for some time from having their full weight. When once they
did so, the issue could not long be in doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor was the very real, if somewhat vague, monotheism
which Mithraism taught, very likely to attract, at first sight,
the enthusiasm of a large and mixed population engaged in civil
pursuits. If the conjecture made above be correct, the Mithraist
in the ordinary way acknowledged no other god than Mithras,
although he would probably have admitted that he was but
the representative and antitype of the supreme Jupiter whom
he recognized as the official head of the State pantheon. As for
the other gods, he probably considered them as mere abstract
personifications of the powers of Nature, who were at the most
the creatures and subjects of Mithras “the friend,” and whom
it might please him to propitiate by acts of worship which the
god would know how to appreciate. This is not very far from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>theories of the Stoics, always dear to the nobler spirits in the
Roman Empire, and coupled with the high Stoic ideal of duty,
forms one of the best working philosophies for the soldier ever
devised. But the soldier, removed as he is from care for his
daily necessities, and with instant and ready obedience to
another will than his own constantly required of him, has
always held different views on such subjects to the civilian;
and such ideas were rather above the heads of the crowd, sunk
for the most part in abject poverty, utterly absorbed in the
struggle for daily bread, and only anxious to snatch some
passing enjoyment from a life of toil. What they, and even
more urgently, their womenfolk needed was a God, not towering
above them like the Eternal Sun, the eye of Mithras and his
earthly representative, shedding his radiance impartially upon
the just and the unjust; but a God who had walked upon the
earth in human form, who had known like themselves pain and
affliction, and to whom they could therefore look for sympathy
and help. Such a god was not to be found in the Mithraic
Cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons, probably, Mithraism fell after a reign of
little more than two centuries. Yet for good or ill, few religions
have lived in vain; and some of the ideas which it made
popular in Europe have hardly yet died out. The theory that
the emperor, king, or chief of the State is of a different nature
to other men, and is in a peculiar manner the care of the gods,
was first formulated in the West during the time that Mithraism
was in power and is a great deal more the creation of the Persian
religion than of the Egyptian, in which he was said to be the
incarnation of the Sun-God. This is fairly plain from the custom
to which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has lately drawn attention of releasing
at the funeral or apotheosis of a Roman emperor a captive
eagle, representing the soul of the dead ruler, the upward flight
of the bird being held typical of the soul’s ascension into heaven<a id='r984'></a><a href='#f984' class='c008'><sup>[984]</sup></a>.
The connection of this practice with Mithraism is evident, since
“eagle” was one of the names given to the perfect Mithraist,
or he who had taken all the seven degrees of initiation, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>therefore earned the right to be called <span lang="la"><i>pater sacrorum</i></span><a id='r985'></a><a href='#f985' class='c008'><sup>[985]</sup></a>. The
Christian emperors of Rome continued probably the practice
and certainly the nomenclature associated with it, and Constantine
and his successors were hailed by the Mithraic epithets
of “aeternus,” “invictus,” and “felix” as freely as his Pagan
predecessors. From this period the notion of the “divinity
that doth hedge a king” descended to comparatively modern
times, and “Sacred Majesty” was an epithet of our own kings
down to the reign of the last Stuart. Probably, too, it was the
custom of releasing an eagle at a royal funeral which so impressed
the popular imagination that the metaphor became
transferred, as such things generally are sooner or later, to the
lower ranks of the community, and the figure of the soul being
borne aloft on wings took the place that it still occupies in
popular Christian literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The share that Mithraism had in diffusing the practices of
magic and astrology is by no means so clear. That the Mithraists,
like other pagans of the early centuries, were addicted to
magic is one of the most frequent accusations brought against
them by Christian writers, and the word magic itself, as has
been said above, is derived from those Magi from whom the
Mithraists were said to have derived their doctrine. In support
of this, it can certainly be said that the worshippers of Mithras
by rendering a modified cult to Ahriman, whom the Christians
identified with Satan, laid themselves open to the suspicion of
trafficking with devils, and it is quite possible that they, like
the followers of many other religions at the time, looked with
favour upon the compulsion rather than the propitiation of the
lower powers. Yet the strict monotheism of the faith which
practically looked to Mithras for the ultimate control and
regulation of all sublunary things, is certainly against this conclusion;
and it should be noticed that the laws against the
practices of magic and astrology, then so intertwined that it is
difficult to separate them<a id='r986'></a><a href='#f986' class='c008'><sup>[986]</sup></a>, were quite as severe under emperors
like Commodus and Diocletian who worshipped Mithras, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>under those of their successors who professed the faith of
Christ. The rites of Hecate, however, were, as we have seen,
closely connected with those of Mithras and were generally in
the hands of Mithraists. These Hecatean rites seem to have
been almost entirely magical in their character, and it is the
name of Hecate that was handed down as that of the patroness
of sorcerers through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance<a id='r987'></a><a href='#f987' class='c008'><sup>[987]</sup></a>.
One of the priests of Mithras also goes out of his way to declare
on his epitaph that he is <i>studiosus astrologiae</i>, and on the whole
the Christian accusation was probably not without foundation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>
  <h2 id='chap13' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr> <br> MANES AND THE MANICHAEANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is generally said that the religion of Mithras ended and
was absorbed in Manichaeism, which may thus be supposed to
have inherited some, at least, of its doctrines<a id='r988'></a><a href='#f988' class='c008'><sup>[988]</sup></a>. This is one of
those statements which are copied by one author from another
until they acquire by mere repetition the force of an axiom;
but its truth is not obvious, nor does it appear to rest upon any
sound foundation. Except in the fact that both Mithraism and
Manichaeism came in the first instance from Persia, there is
little likeness between the two faiths, which are in all essential
respects diametrically opposed to each other. A strict dualism,
or the eternal antagonism of two equal principles, is the distinguishing
feature of the religion of Manes, while the worship
of Mithras rested, as has been said in the last chapter, on an
equally uncompromising monotheism, which made the Supreme
Being, whether known as Jupiter or Ormuzd, at once the
creator and the governor of the universe. In this respect, it
drew near to Judaism, which it may have aimed at incorporating
with itself, and was not ashamed to place on its
monuments scenes which can be referred to the Old Testament<a id='r989'></a><a href='#f989' class='c008'><sup>[989]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Manichaeism, on the other hand, looked on Judaism with
horror, rejected the Old Testament entirely, and was not
improbably born in an outbreak of anti-Semitic fury<a id='r990'></a><a href='#f990' class='c008'><sup>[990]</sup></a>. But
the discrepancy of doctrine is as nothing compared to the wide
difference in those external matters which in a new religion
most strike the imagination of the crowd, and have therefore
much to do with its success or failure. The Mithraist was
accustomed, as we have seen, to an allegorical and symbolical
ritual in which the material image of his god was for ever
before him; but the Manichaean, as we shall see later, forbade
the use of images and his worship consisted merely of prayers
and hymns. The Mithraists made frequent use in their
ceremonies of the sacrifice of animals; but the Manichaeans
looked with displeasure on the taking of the life even of plants.
The worshipper of Mithras not only gloried in the outward
profession of his religion, but by his avoidance of the wearing
of garlands forced the notice of it on those of his fellows who
were not of the faith. The follower of Manes, on the contrary,
concealed his religion as carefully as Basilides wished his
followers to conceal theirs, and even went to the length of
outwardly adopting a creed different from his own. It is not
therefore to be wondered at that the rulers of the Roman
Empire, whose acquaintance with the worship of Mithras was
a thousand times more profound than our own, should have
favoured Mithraism and have made every effort to suppress
Manichaeism. The very emperors who placed their reformed
State under the protection of Mithras imposed the penalty
of death upon those of their subjects who should venture
to teach the religion of Manes<a id='r991'></a><a href='#f991' class='c008'><sup>[991]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Not less different were the sanctions with which Mithraism
and Manichaeism appeared in the West. The worship of
Mithras came into the Roman world unobtrusively and without
any claim to an exclusive revelation or special means of propaganda.
But Manichaeism had at its back the personality of
one of those wonderful men who appear at rare intervals in the
world’s history, to leave behind them a memorial of their
empire over the minds of their fellows in the shape of a new
creed. Manes was indeed, as the discoveries of the last decade
have taught us, an innovator in religion entirely worthy to
rank with Zoroaster, Buddha, and Muhammad, and when the
difficulties in the way of his missionary activity are considered,
his influence upon the religious ideas of those who came after
him was at least as marked as that of any of them. Manes or
Mânî—the first being the Greek form of the name—was born,
according to his own deliberate statement, about the year
216 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, in a village of Babylonia called Mardînû situate
on the Kutha canal to the south of Ctesiphon<a id='r992'></a><a href='#f992' class='c008'><sup>[992]</sup></a>. According to
Christian tradition, his real name was Corbicius or Kubrik and
he was a slave of unknown birth<a id='r993'></a><a href='#f993' class='c008'><sup>[993]</sup></a>; according to the Mahommedan
writers his father was one Patecius or Fatak, while his
mother is sometimes described as the “Lady Mary,” sometimes
as a Parthian princess, and is sometimes named Karossa<a id='r994'></a><a href='#f994' class='c008'><sup>[994]</sup></a>.
Such legends grow up naturally round the birth of all founders
of religions, and we should believe them the less in this case
that they have been handed down to us by the professors of
religions bitterly opposed to that of Manes. Yet the story
about the Parthian princess seems confirmed by the free access
that he seems to have always possessed to the court of the
Persian monarchs of his time. Manes himself says, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>to Al-Bîrûnî, that illumination came to him in his thirteenth
year<a id='r995'></a><a href='#f995' class='c008'><sup>[995]</sup></a>; but this is contradicted by the <i>Fihrist</i>, which puts the
age at which he received revelation as twenty-four<a id='r996'></a><a href='#f996' class='c008'><sup>[996]</sup></a>. The <i>Acta
Archelai</i>, a Christian source obviously suspect in the state it
has come down to us, would make him a priest of Mithras<a id='r997'></a><a href='#f997' class='c008'><sup>[997]</sup></a>, a
tradition which may have originated at a date when the Catholic
Church recognized the danger to itself involved in the spread of
the Mithraic religion. Another story would make him a Magus
or one of the priestly caste entrusted by Ardeshîr with the propagation
of the reformed religion of Zoroaster<a id='r998'></a><a href='#f998' class='c008'><sup>[998]</sup></a>, which is discredited
by the fact that it was the Magi who were from the
outset his bitterest enemies<a id='r999'></a><a href='#f999' class='c008'><sup>[999]</sup></a>. A late Oriental writer says that
he was a Christian priest having a cure of souls at Ahvâz<a id='r1000'></a><a href='#f1000' class='c008'><sup>[1000]</sup></a>, the
capital city of the province of Huzitis, which again is negatived
by the fact that he seems from his writings to have had little
more than a hearsay knowledge of Catholic Christianity,
although they show some acquaintance with the heresies of
Bardesanes and Marcion<a id='r1001'></a><a href='#f1001' class='c008'><sup>[1001]</sup></a>. He is said to have acquired great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>skill in painting which he used to illustrate his teaching<a id='r1002'></a><a href='#f1002' class='c008'><sup>[1002]</sup></a>, and
to have been a learned mathematician and astronomer. This
is likely enough; but the only events of his life which seem
well attested, are that he began at an early age to propagate
his doctrine and that he succeeded in converting to it Peroz or
Fîrûz the son of Ardeshîr, through whose means he obtained
a formal hearing from Sapor or Shâpûr, the conqueror of
Valerian and Ardeshîr’s successor, shortly after this king’s
accession to the throne<a id='r1003'></a><a href='#f1003' class='c008'><sup>[1003]</sup></a>. Sapor seems to have listened to
Manes with respect and, according to an Oriental writer, to have
even favoured his propaganda, until the Magi, to whom the
revival of the Zoroastrian religion had been committed, convinced
him of his error<a id='r1004'></a><a href='#f1004' class='c008'><sup>[1004]</sup></a>. On this, Manes was exiled from
Persia and retired, says Al-Bîrûnî, to India, China, and Thibet
preaching his gospel<a id='r1005'></a><a href='#f1005' class='c008'><sup>[1005]</sup></a>. On Sapor’s death, he returned to Persia
under Hormisdas or Ormuz, and again, it is said, succeeded in
converting to his tenets the reigning monarch<a id='r1006'></a><a href='#f1006' class='c008'><sup>[1006]</sup></a>. On Varanes’
or Bahram’s accession to the throne the following year, however,
he was seized and put to death as a heretic after a disputation
with the Chief of the Magi, in which he failed to support the
test of an ordeal by molten metal proposed to him<a id='r1007'></a><a href='#f1007' class='c008'><sup>[1007]</sup></a>. The most
likely account of his death narrates that he was decapitated,
and that his skin stuffed with straw was suspended at the gate
of the town where the execution took place<a id='r1008'></a><a href='#f1008' class='c008'><sup>[1008]</sup></a>. This was followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>by a great persecution of the Manichaeans throughout Persia,
and it is fairly evident that this, like his own fate, was due to
the hostility he had aroused in the Magi<a id='r1009'></a><a href='#f1009' class='c008'><sup>[1009]</sup></a>. The date of his
death is fixed with some accuracy at 275 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, so that he would
then have reached the age of sixty years<a id='r1010'></a><a href='#f1010' class='c008'><sup>[1010]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes underlying this sudden appearance of a new
religion are doubtless to be looked for in the political and
religious history of Persia at the time. Ardeshîr, as has been
said above, gave new life to the feeling of Persian nationality
which the Parthian Kings had kept alive during Greek supremacy
in Asia, and succeeded in again founding a Persian
Empire. Like Alexander, Antiochus Epiphanes, and again,
Diocletian, he seems to have been thoroughly alive to the great
effect that a faith common to the whole empire would have in
uniting the peoples under his sway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never forget,” he says in the supposed testament that he is said to
have left for the guidance of his son Sapor, “that as a king you
are at once the protector of religion and of your country. Consider
the altar and the throne as inseparable and that they must always
sustain each other. A sovereign without religion is a tyrant,
and a people which have no religion may be deemed the most
monstrous of all societies. Religion may exist without a State,
but a State cannot exist without religion; and it is by holy laws
that a political association can alone be bound<a id='r1011'></a><a href='#f1011' class='c008'><sup>[1011]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet in spite of these sentiments, more pithily expressed perhaps
in the “No bishop, no king” of our own James <abbr title='the first'>I</abbr>, the task of
founding a common religion for the whole of the new Persian
empire must have presented some uncommon difficulties.
Apart from the strong Semitic element dominant in their
Babylonian province, the Parthians had always been eclectic
in matters of faith, and Vonones, one of the last kings of
Parthia, had shown himself to be a Philhellene of a type which
must have been peculiarly offensive to a sovereign who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>trying to revive the old Persian nationality<a id='r1012'></a><a href='#f1012' class='c008'><sup>[1012]</sup></a>. The worship of
Mithras, the god most favoured by the legions with whom
Ardeshîr was soon to be at death-grips, must have been equally
out of the question; and the knowledge of this is probably to
be seen in the low place in the celestial hierarchy assigned to
the old Vedic god in the Avesta of Ardeshîr’s day<a id='r1013'></a><a href='#f1013' class='c008'><sup>[1013]</sup></a>. The
Jewish religion in Central Asia had lately given signs of proselytizing
fervour, and it was the going-over of a Parthian kinglet
against the will of his people to the Jewish faith which first,
according to one account, gave the excuse for the intervention
of Vologeses or Valkhash and the subsequent reformation or
revival of the Zoroastrian religion<a id='r1014'></a><a href='#f1014' class='c008'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>. At the same time, Christianity
had already begun to share with Mithraism the devotion
of the legions stationed on the Roman frontier, and in the
Gnostic form favoured by the teaching of Marcion and
Bardesanes was pushing into Persia from Armenia and Edessa<a id='r1015'></a><a href='#f1015' class='c008'><sup>[1015]</sup></a>.
Nor can we doubt that Buddhism, already perhaps struck with
decay in its native country of India<a id='r1016'></a><a href='#f1016' class='c008'><sup>[1016]</sup></a>, but flourishing exceedingly
further East, was trying to obtain a foothold in that very
Bactria which was afterwards said to have been the historic
scene of Zoroaster’s activity. Other small, but, as the event
was to show, highly vitalized faiths, were current in Western
Asia, and the power of the Magi when Ardeshîr overthrew the
Parthian power had declined so greatly that the statues of the
Parthian kings were placed in the temples of the gods and
adored equally with those of the divinities<a id='r1017'></a><a href='#f1017' class='c008'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>. The Persians of
Herodotus’ time, who did not believe in deities who had the
same nature as men, would have blushed at such a profanation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>From this unpromising welter of creeds and cults, Ardeshîr
delivered the State by restoring the worship of Ahura Mazda
as the State religion. One of his first cares was to collect the
fragments of the books which we now know as the Zend Avesta,
in which the revelations of the national prophet Zoroaster were
set down in a language not then understanded of the people.
It was afterwards said that the <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> of these books had purposely
been destroyed or scattered by Alexander; but the fact
seems to be that they had fallen into discredit through the
turning-away of the Persians towards Hellenic and Semitic
gods; and that a previous attempt to restore their authority
by Valkhash or Vologeses <abbr title='the first'>I</abbr>, the Parthian king who reigned
from 50 to 75 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, had met with little encouragement from his
subjects<a id='r1018'></a><a href='#f1018' class='c008'><sup>[1018]</sup></a>. Most modern scholars are now agreed that the
Avesta and the literature that grew up round it contain many
doctrines not to be found in the Persian religion current in
Achaemenian times, and evidently brought into it from foreign
sources under the Hellenistic and Parthian kings. Such as it is,
however, the Avesta formed the Sacred Book of Ardeshîr’s
reformation; while, in the order of the Magi, by him restored
to more than their former power, the reformed Zoroastrian
faith possessed an active, established, and persecuting Church,
which reigned in Persia without a serious rival until the Mahommedan
invasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet the first struggles of the reformation must have been
sharp, and Darmesteter was doubtless justified when he saw in
Manichaeism the first and possibly the strongest expression of
the revulsion of Ardeshîr’s subjects against the rigid orthodoxy
which he sought to impose upon them<a id='r1019'></a><a href='#f1019' class='c008'><sup>[1019]</sup></a>. That such a feeling
persisted for some time is plain from the fact that Manes’
“heresy” is said by Al-Bîrûnî to have been followed by that of
Mazdak, who seems to have preached, like the Antinomian
sects of Cromwell’s time, a kind of Socialism including the
community of women and of property<a id='r1020'></a><a href='#f1020' class='c008'><sup>[1020]</sup></a>. There arose also
about the same time or a little later the sect of Zervanists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>referred to in the chapter on Mithras, who taught that Boundless
Time was the origin of all things and was superior to
Ormuzd and Ahriman, to both of whom he was said to have
given birth. They seemed to have gained great power in the
reign of Yezdegerd <abbr title='the second'>II</abbr>; and, if we may trust the Armenian
authors, a proclamation commanding adherence to their
doctrines was put forth by Yezdegerd’s general Mihr Nerses on
his invasion of Armenia in 450 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r1021'></a><a href='#f1021' class='c008'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> But the earliest and most
enduring of these heresies or rebellions against the purified
and restored religion of Ahura Mazda appears to have been
that of Manes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were now the doctrines that Manes preached to his own
undoing his invention, or did he draw them from some pre-existent
source? It is said, in a Christian account which has
come down to us, that they were the work of one Scythianus<a id='r1022'></a><a href='#f1022' class='c008'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>,
a native, as his name implies, of “Scythia” (which here probably
means Turkestan) and a contemporary of the Apostles, who
married an Egyptian slave and learned from her all the wisdom
of the Egyptians<a id='r1023'></a><a href='#f1023' class='c008'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>. With the help of this and the tincture of
dualism which he extracted from “the works of Pythagoras,” the
story goes on to say, Scythianus constructed a system which
he taught to a disciple named Terebinthus, otherwise called
Buddas or Buddha, before his own death in Judaea<a id='r1024'></a><a href='#f1024' class='c008'><sup>[1024]</sup></a>. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Terebinthus gave out that he was born of a virgin and had been
nursed by an angel on a mountain; and he also wrote four
books in which the doctrines of Scythianus were set down<a id='r1025'></a><a href='#f1025' class='c008'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>.
These books he entrusted to an aged widow with whom he
lived, and he was afterwards struck dead while performing a
magical ceremony. On his death, she bought a boy of seven
years old named Corbicius, whom she enfranchised, and to
whom she left her property and Terebinthus’ books some five
years later. Thus equipped, Corbicius took the name of
Manes, which may signify “Cup” or “Vessel<a id='r1026'></a><a href='#f1026' class='c008'><sup>[1026]</sup></a>,” and began to
preach. This history has evidently been much corrupted and
by no means agrees with the account before quoted from
Oriental sources which bears greater marks of authenticity;
but it is thought by some to be, like the 14th chapter of Genesis,
a sort of allegory in which the names of peoples and systems
are given as those of individual men<a id='r1027'></a><a href='#f1027' class='c008'><sup>[1027]</sup></a>. If this be so, we should
perhaps see in Scythianus the representative of those non-Aryan
tribes of Medes of whom the Magi formed part, while
in the name of Buddha we might find that of one of those
Judaean communities holding a mixture of Magian and
Buddhist tenets who according to one tradition were for long
encamped near the Dead Sea<a id='r1028'></a><a href='#f1028' class='c008'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>. Yet there is nothing specifically
Buddhist or Egyptian about the doctrines of Manes as we
know them<a id='r1029'></a><a href='#f1029' class='c008'><sup>[1029]</sup></a>, and if there were any likeness between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>mythology and observances of the cult and those of its predecessors,
it was probably introduced by Manes’ followers rather
than by himself<a id='r1030'></a><a href='#f1030' class='c008'><sup>[1030]</sup></a>. As to the doctrines of the Magi, Manes
certainly had no occasion to go to Judaea to find them; for
in the Persia of Ardeshîr and Sapor he must have heard quite
as much of them as he wished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably, therefore, the Christian account of Manes’ sources
is untrue, or rather, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Rochat suggests, it was composed at a
time and place in which Manichaeism had become a heresy or
alternative creed attached, so to speak, not to Zoroastrianism but
to Christianity, and had picked up from this and other faiths
many accretions<a id='r1031'></a><a href='#f1031' class='c008'><sup>[1031]</sup></a>. The doctrine of Manes which has come
down to us from other sources is extremely simple, and seems
to accord better with the Puritanical simplicity of life and
ritual afterwards practised by his followers. Both the
Christian and the Mahommedan traditions agree that he believed
that there were two gods, uncreated and eternal, and everlastingly
opposed to each other<a id='r1032'></a><a href='#f1032' class='c008'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>. One of these is the God of
Light and the other the God of Darkness; but he does not
seem to have given any specific or proper name to either<a id='r1033'></a><a href='#f1033' class='c008'><sup>[1033]</sup></a>.
It is possible that this last-named being may have been identified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>by him with Matter<a id='r1034'></a><a href='#f1034' class='c008'><sup>[1034]</sup></a>, although this would seem to be a remnant
of the Platonic philosophy of which there is no other trace in
his teaching. But it is certain that he regarded the God of
Darkness as entirely evil, that is to say, malevolent, and as
a power to propitiate whom man should make no attempt.
“I have considered it needful to despatch this letter to you”
says an epistle which there is much reason to consider expresses
the opinions, if not the actual words, of Manes himself<a id='r1035'></a><a href='#f1035' class='c008'><sup>[1035]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“first for the salvation of your soul and then to secure you against
dubious opinions, and especially against notions such as those teach
who lead astray the more simple (ἁπλούστεροι), alleging that both
good and evil come from the same Power, and introducing but one
principle, and neither distinguishing nor separating the darkness
from the light, and the good from the bad and the evil (φαῦλον),
and that which is without man from that which is within him, as
we have said formerly, so that they cease not to confuse and mingle
one thing with another. But do not thou, O my son, like most men,
unreasonably and foolishly join the two together nor ascribe them
both to the God of Goodness. For these teachers attribute to God
the beginning and the end, and make him the father of these ills <i>the
end of which is near a curse</i><a id='r1036'></a><a href='#f1036' class='c008'><sup>[1036]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Although this epistle bears evident marks of having been
worked over and amplified by some writer of a later age than
that of the founder of Manichaeism, there cannot be much
doubt that it contains his teaching on the Two Principles of
all things. In the Christian account of Manes’ doctrine which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span><abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Rochat thinks earlier than the epistle quoted above, Manes’
<i>quondam</i> follower Turbo says after recantation that his master
reverences two gods “unbegotten, self-existing (αὐτοφυεῖς),
eternal and set over against each other,” and that “he represents
one as good, the other as wicked, giving to the one the
name of Light and to the other that of Darkness<a id='r1037'></a><a href='#f1037' class='c008'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>.” So, too,
the Mahommedan writers who give what seems to be an independent
account of Manes’ opinions are agreed that he deduced
the origin of the world from “two Original Principles, one of
which is Light and the other Darkness, and which are separated
one from the other<a id='r1038'></a><a href='#f1038' class='c008'><sup>[1038]</sup></a>.” The absolute opposition from the outset
of good and evil therefore formed the pivot of Manes’ whole
system, and was opposed quite as much to the Christian and
Jewish creeds as to the Mithraic and other modifications of
Persian religious ideas then or later in vogue, which held that
evil like good was the creation of the Supreme Being, and that
Ahriman or Pluto was a god having subordinate authority to,
but of the same nature as, Ormuzd or Zeus. This uncompromisingly
dualistic theory gives an origin to evil independent
of that of good, and can only lead logically to the assertion of
its eternity. Whether Manes gave utterance to it for the first
time, or derived it from a theology then current in Persia, there
is little evidence to show<a id='r1039'></a><a href='#f1039' class='c008'><sup>[1039]</sup></a>. The Zend Avesta itself in its
Sassanian recension does not seem to pronounce clearly on this
point, and has been thought by some high authorities to teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the subordinate origin and ultimate extinction of evil<a id='r1040'></a><a href='#f1040' class='c008'><sup>[1040]</sup></a>, and by
others exactly the reverse. It does, however, seem to be clear
that unless Manes invented <i>de novo</i> the doctrine above quoted,
it must have been from Persia that he obtained it. No other
country with which he can have become acquainted has yet
been shown to possess it<a id='r1041'></a><a href='#f1041' class='c008'><sup>[1041]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exclusively Oriental, too, in its origin must be the history
of the conflict between these two Principles which follows.
Each of them apparently dwelt in his own domain for countless
ages untroubled by the existence of the other. The Light is
the uppermost and is, according to the Mahommedan version
of Manes’ doctrine, without bounds in height and on each side.
The Darkness lies below it, and is in like manner boundless in
depth and in lateral extent<a id='r1042'></a><a href='#f1042' class='c008'><sup>[1042]</sup></a>. Hence there is a long frontier
at which they touch, and this spot was filled from the beginning
by the celestial air and the celestial earth. If we may read
into the tradition something which is not expressed there, but
which seems to follow logically from it, this atmosphere and
this earth were the heavier parts of the Divine substance,
which sinking down formed a kind of sediment or deposit<a id='r1043'></a><a href='#f1043' class='c008'><sup>[1043]</sup></a>.
Each of these Two Principles has five “members” or components,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and this partition into five seems in the Manichaean teaching
to run through all things. Thus, the Mahommedan tradition
tells us that the “members” of the God of Light are Gentleness,
Knowledge, Intelligence, Discretion, and Discernment, those of
the Air the same five, of the (celestial) earth, the Breeze or
Ether, Wind, Light, Water, and Fire, and of the Darkness
Smoke, Flame, Hot Wind, Poison or Pestilence, and Gloom
or Fog<a id='r1044'></a><a href='#f1044' class='c008'><sup>[1044]</sup></a>. In this, and especially in its deification of abstract
principles, we may see a reflection of Gnostic teaching which
may easily have reached Manes from Valentinus by way of
Bardesanes and the Oriental or Edessan School. On the other
hand, the borrowing may have been the other way, and Simon
Magus may have obtained these notions from the Persian Magi
and have handed them on to Valentinus and his successors.
This does not seem so likely as the other, but the point can
hardly be settled until we know more than we do at present
of the state of the Persian religion from the time of the
Achaemenian kings to the Sassanian reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>However that may be, both the Christian and Mahommedan
traditions are agreed that the aggressor in the struggle between
the good God and the bad was the Evil One. The Mahommedan
source, here fuller than the Christian, tells us that the Darkness
remained in an unorganized condition for ages, although
consisting of the five members enumerated above. These parts,
however, seem to have sunk down and produced another
Earth called the Darker Earth, from which in course of time
came forth Satan. Satan was not, like the King of the Paradise
of Light, without beginning, but came into being from the
union of these five members of Darkness, having the head of
a lion, the body of a serpent, the wings of a bird, the tail of
a fish, and four feet like those of crawling animals<a id='r1045'></a><a href='#f1045' class='c008'><sup>[1045]</sup></a>, in which
figure we may see a kind of reflection of the Mithraic Ahriman<a id='r1046'></a><a href='#f1046' class='c008'><sup>[1046]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Satan, on his emergence on the Darker Earth, perceived the
rays of light from the upper world, piercing as we may suppose
through the gloomy atmosphere of his own world, and conceived
a hatred for them. Seeing, too, that these rays gained much
in strength by their combination and mutual support, he
withdrew within himself so as to unite himself more closely
with his members<a id='r1047'></a><a href='#f1047' class='c008'><sup>[1047]</sup></a>. Then again springing upwards, he invaded
the realms of Light with the intention of there spreading
calamity and destruction. The aeon—or world as the <i>Fihrist</i>
calls it—of Discernment was the first to be aware of this
invasion<a id='r1048'></a><a href='#f1048' class='c008'><sup>[1048]</sup></a>, and reported it to the aeon Knowledge, from whom
it passed to the others in turn until it at last reached the ear
of the Good God, here, as elsewhere in the <i>Fihrist</i>, called the
King of the Paradise of Light. With the aid of the Spirit of
his Right Hand, of his five worlds or members before mentioned,
and of his twelve elements, of which we have before heard
nothing<a id='r1049'></a><a href='#f1049' class='c008'><sup>[1049]</sup></a>, he made the First Man, clothing him by way of
armour with the five “species” or powers of the celestial earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the Breeze, Wind, Light, Water and Fire as before enumerated<a id='r1050'></a><a href='#f1050' class='c008'><sup>[1050]</sup></a>.
With these He despatched him to fight Satan, who in his turn
did on his armour in the shape of <i>his</i> five “species,” Smoke,
Flame, Poison, Hot Wind, and Gloom<a id='r1051'></a><a href='#f1051' class='c008'><sup>[1051]</sup></a>. The fight lasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>long, but in the end Satan triumphed, and dragged the First
Man down into the Realm of Darkness, where he took from him
his light<a id='r1052'></a><a href='#f1052' class='c008'><sup>[1052]</sup></a>. During the fight, too, the elements had become
mingled, so that the Ether henceforth was mixed with the
Smoke, the Fire with the Flame, the Light with the Darkness,
the Wind with the Hot Wind, and the Cloud with the Water.
This it is which brings about the confusion or mixture seen in
the present world, wherein everything which is beautiful, pure,
or useful, such as gold and silver, comes from the armour of
the First Man, and everything foul, impure, and gross, from
that of his infernal opponent<a id='r1053'></a><a href='#f1053' class='c008'><sup>[1053]</sup></a>. After the fight, the King of
the Paradise of Light descended with another Power called the
Friend of the Lights, who overthrew Satan, and the Spirit of
the Right Hand or Mother of Life recalled, either by her voice
or by another power called the Living Spirit, the First Man from
his prison in the lowest Darkness. The First Man, on his
deliverance, in this account mounts again to the Realms of
Light, but before doing so “cuts the roots” of the Five Infernal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Elements so that they can no more increase<a id='r1054'></a><a href='#f1054' class='c008'><sup>[1054]</sup></a>. Then the King
of the Paradise of Light orders an angel to draw the Confusion
or Mixture of the Elements to that part of the Realm of Darkness
which touches the Realm of Light, and to create out of
it the present world, so as to deliver the imprisoned elements
of Light from the Darkness with which they are contaminated.
This is done, and a Universe having six heavens and eight
earths is formed, each heaven having twelve gates, together with
terraces, corridors, and places in such profusion as to point to
some confusion in the translation into the Syriac which has come
down to us. The only thing that concerns us in this, perhaps, is
that the visible world, presumably the lowest of the eight, has
a ditch dug round it in which is thrown the Matter of Darkness
as it is separated from the Light, and outside this a wall so that
it cannot escape. This is in view of the End of the World<a id='r1055'></a><a href='#f1055' class='c008'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>So far there is no great difference—at all events, no irreconcilable
difference—between the Christian and the Mahommedan
accounts of Manes’ doctrines. The machinery set up
for the process of the redemption of the light, however, differs
somewhat conspicuously in the two traditions. The Mahommedan
writers declare that in Manes’ teaching the Sun and
Moon were created for the purification of the Light, the Sun
drawing to itself those light-elements which had become
contaminated by the demons of heat and flame and the Moon
exercising a like attraction on those which had suffered from
the embrace of Satan’s other powers. Both luminaries bear
these elements into the Column of Praises or Glory which is
perpetually mounting from the Sun to the World of Light,
bearing with it the praises of men, their hymns of gratitude,
and their pure words and good works<a id='r1056'></a><a href='#f1056' class='c008'><sup>[1056]</sup></a>. This will continue until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>none but a feeble fragment of the Light remains in this world,
when the angels charged with its maintenance will abandon their
task, and return to the World of Light. A fire will then break
out, which will burn for 1468 years and will set free the remainder
of the Light imprisoned in matter by consuming its envelope.
Satan or Hummâma, the Spirit of Darkness, will then acknowledge
his defeat, and will be driven into the tomb prepared for
him, the entrance to which will be closed with a stone the size
of the world<a id='r1057'></a><a href='#f1057' class='c008'><sup>[1057]</sup></a>. In the Christian tradition these matters are
more complicated, and Manes is said to have taught that there
exists a great wheel bearing twelve vases or buckets after the
fashion of an Egyptian <i>sakiyeh</i>, which raise the redeemed
portions of Light to the Sun, who gives them to the Moon,
who in her turn delivers them to the Aeons of the Light, who
place them in the Column of Glory here called the Perfect Air<a id='r1058'></a><a href='#f1058' class='c008'><sup>[1058]</sup></a>.
The Christian account is also more detailed with regard to the
functions of the angels charged with the conduct of the world,
making out that one of them supports this earth on his shoulders
and is therefore called Omophorus, great earthquakes and
commotions taking place when from weariness he shifts his
burthen from one shoulder to the other, while another, called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Splenditenens, holds the heavens by their backs<a id='r1059'></a><a href='#f1059' class='c008'><sup>[1059]</sup></a>. The stars
are also in the Christian tradition fashioned out of the purer
part of the Light which was <i>not</i> captured by the Satanic powers,
whereas the Mahommedan tradition says nothing about their
origin<a id='r1060'></a><a href='#f1060' class='c008'><sup>[1060]</sup></a>. The Christian writers also make the Manichaeans tell
a story about the appearance of a beautiful virgin who appears
to the male and female devils who were crucified or fixed in
this world on the deliverance of the First Man. She appears
to the male fiends as a beautiful woman and to the female as
a desirable young man; and when they covet and pursue her,
she flies from them and disappears. The anger of the Great
Archon or Satan on this causes the appearance of clouds in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>this world and thereby obscures the Sun’s light, whilst his
sweat becomes rain<a id='r1061'></a><a href='#f1061' class='c008'><sup>[1061]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the origin of terrestrial man, there is also considerable
discrepancy between the two streams of tradition. The
Mahommedan tells us that Adam was born from the conjunction
of one of “these Archons” or Princes, and a star. Nothing is
said to tell us what is meant by “these” princes, but as the
phrase is used in other passages by the same writer to denote the
Satanic hierarchy one can but suppose that it is one of the rulers
of darkness who is here indicated<a id='r1062'></a><a href='#f1062' class='c008'><sup>[1062]</sup></a>. The same writer goes on
to say that the conjunction was “beheld” [or aided?] by a pair
of Archons, one male and the other female, and that a second
similar conjunction resulted in the birth of Eve. There is
evidently a reference here to some legend of which we have
lost the trace<a id='r1063'></a><a href='#f1063' class='c008'><sup>[1063]</sup></a>, and the Christian tradition assigns to Adam an
entirely different origin and declares that he was made by all
the “princes” or archons on the advice of one of their number,
who persuaded the others to give up some of the light they had
received which they knew would otherwise be taken from them
and to make from it man in their own image and after the form
of the “First Man” against whom they had fought with temporary
success<a id='r1064'></a><a href='#f1064' class='c008'><sup>[1064]</sup></a>. This story is clearly the same as that which
we have already seen current among the Ophites, and it now
seems most probable that it here appears not—as was once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>thought—as an interpolation foisted into the teaching of
Manes by the Christian writer, but because both Ophite and
Manichaean derived the story independently of each other from
legends current in Western Asia<a id='r1065'></a><a href='#f1065' class='c008'><sup>[1065]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mahommedan writer then plunges into a long and
elaborate account of how the “Five Angels,” meaning thereby
apparently the “members” Gentleness, Knowledge, Intelligence,
Discretion and Discernment, on beholding Adam and
Eve, prayed to certain powers which seem to be those which
descended with the King of the Paradise of Light after the
defeat of the First Man properly so called. These Powers
include the First Man himself and the Mother of Life<a id='r1066'></a><a href='#f1066' class='c008'><sup>[1066]</sup></a>, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Living Spirit<a id='r1067'></a><a href='#f1067' class='c008'><sup>[1067]</sup></a>, and were besought by the Five to send to earth
a Saviour who should give Adam and Eve Knowledge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Goodness and deliver them from the devils. Their prayer was
heard, and Jesus was sent upon earth “accompanied by a god,”
with whose aid the Archons were again overthrown and imprisoned,
while Adam and Eve were set free<a id='r1068'></a><a href='#f1068' class='c008'><sup>[1068]</sup></a>. Jesus then
addressed Adam and revealed to him the whole secret of the
cosmogony, enlightening him upon the origin and functions of
the different heavenly worlds or paradises, of the gods, of hell,
of the devils, of the earth and sky, and of the sun and moon.
He then showed him, continues the Mahommedan tradition,
the seductive power of Eve, put him on his guard against it,
and breathed into him the fear of yielding to it. Adam, it is
said, listened to these commands obediently.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result of this abstinence on Adam’s part—we are still
pursuing the Mahommedan account of the Manichaean teaching—was
seen in the sequel. The Archon or Demon who was
practically the father of the present race of mankind became
enamoured of Eve, and engendering with her begot a son “ugly
and of a reddish colour,” who was named Cain. Cain in turn
had relations with his mother Eve, and from this incest was
born a son of white colour who was named Abel. From the
further intercourse of Cain and Eve were born two daughters,
one called “the Wisdom of the World,” and the other “the
Daughter of Pleasure.” Cain took the last-named to wife and
gave the other in marriage to Abel; but he did not know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the Wisdom of the World was filled with Light and divine
wisdom, while the Daughter of Pleasure possessed nothing of
the kind. In the sequel, one of the Angels had relations with
the Wisdom of the World and begot two daughters, called
Help (Farjâd) and Bringer of Help (Barfarjâd). Abel accused
Cain of being the father of these girls, whereupon Cain killed
him and took the “Wisdom of the World” as his own second
wife. The Rulers of Darkness were annoyed at this, and the
“Great Devil,” here called Sindîd, taught Eve magical formulas
by the aid of which she again enticed Adam to intercourse.
The result was a son “beautiful and of an agreeable countenance,”
whom Eve wished to kill as having nothing of the
Archons in him. Adam arranged to have the child fed exclusively
on milk and fruits, and drew three magic circles round
him bearing the names of the King of the Paradise of Light,
the First Man, and the Spirit of Life respectively, to protect
him against the devils. He then went to a high place and
entreated God for him, whereupon one of the Three Powers
last named appeared and gave him a Crown of Glory, at the
sight of which Sindîd and the Archons fled away. Then a tree
appeared to Adam called the Lotus, from which he drew milk
with which to nourish his son whom he called first after the
tree, and then Seth (Schâthîl). Eve, on the instigation of Sindîd,
again persuaded Adam to intercourse, which so disgusted Seth
that he took with him the Wisdom of the World, her two
daughters Help and Bringer of Help, and “Siddikût,” which
seems to be the community of the elect or Perfect Manichaeans,
and journeyed to the East in search of the Divine Light and
Wisdom. At their death all these entered into Paradise, while
Eve, Cain, and the daughters of Desire went to hell<a id='r1069'></a><a href='#f1069' class='c008'><sup>[1069]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>The story about the protoplasts of the Book of Genesis has
been given in more detail than it perhaps deserves because of
its manifest connection with the doctrines of the extant sect of
Mandaites, Hemerobaptists, or Disciples of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John still to be
found in certain villages near the Shât-el-Arab and even in
considerable towns like Bussora. These sectaries declare themselves
to have inherited the faith of John the Baptist, and have
a sacred book called the Sidra Rabba, which has been known to
Europeans since the <abbr title='seventeenth'><span class='fss'>XVII</span>th</abbr> century, and contains, among other
things, many stories like those given above. The Mandaites are
a violently anti-Christian sect, and say that the historical Jesus
was a fiend who obtained baptism from <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John the Baptist
by means of a trick, and they display a similar hatred of the
religions of both the Jews and the Mahommedans. Nevertheless,
most modern writers consider them related to, and perhaps
the modern representatives of, the Mughtasilah or “Washers<a id='r1070'></a><a href='#f1070' class='c008'><sup>[1070]</sup></a>.”
This last sect is certainly very ancient, and its history can
in fact be traced as far back as the beginning of the reign of
Trajan<a id='r1071'></a><a href='#f1071' class='c008'><sup>[1071]</sup></a>, while the Mahommedan author, from whom the
traditional account of Manes’ doctrines has been quoted above,
says that Manes was in his youth one of the Mughtasilah. From
this Prof. Kessler, who perhaps devoted more attention to the
Manichaean religion than any living scholar, built up the
theory that the doctrines of the Mughtasilah were one of the
principal sources from which Manes formed his system. He
even says that the Fatak or Patecius whom tradition gives as
a father to Manes must be identified with that Scythianus or
Terebinthus whom the Christian tradition makes Fatak’s
predecessor, was one of the Mughtasilah, and helped Manes
both in the construction of his system and in its propagation<a id='r1072'></a><a href='#f1072' class='c008'><sup>[1072]</sup></a>.
This may be so, but very little evidence is available in support
of the theory; and the points which the Mandaites and the
Manichaeans undoubtedly possess in common do not seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>be more than can be explained by the contact which must necessarily
have taken place between two neighbouring sects both
persecuted successively by Persian Shahs, Christian Emperors,
and Mahommedan Caliphs. The Christian tradition of Manes’
teaching concerning the protoplasts says merely that “he who
said ‘Let us make man in our own image’” was the same Prince
of Darkness who thereby counselled the other Archons to give
up their light in order to make man in the likeness</p>

<p class='c009'>“of the form that we have seen, that is to say, of the First Man.
And in that manner,” it continues, “he created the man. They
created Eve also after the like fashion, imparting to her of their
own lust, with a view to the deceiving of Adam. And by these
means the construction of the world proceeded from the operations
of the Prince<a id='r1073'></a><a href='#f1073' class='c008'><sup>[1073]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The teaching of Manes with regard to Jesus is not very
clear in the Christian tradition, no doubt because the writers
who recorded it were careful to remove from it as much as
possible everything which in their view savoured of blasphemy.
Yet the Christian author before quoted makes Manes say that
the God of Light whom he calls “the Good Father” sent his
well-beloved son upon earth for the salvation of man’s soul
and “because of Omophorus” or the world-sustaining angel.
This son, by whom he can hardly mean any other than the historical
Jesus, “came and transformed himself into the semblance of
a man and showed himself to men as a man, although he was
not a man, and men imagined that he had been begotten<a id='r1074'></a><a href='#f1074' class='c008'><sup>[1074]</sup></a>.”
It is also to Him that is attributed the construction of the
wonderful wheel before alluded to as equipped with twelve vases
which the sphere causes to revolve, and which thus scoops up,
as it were, the souls of the dying<a id='r1075'></a><a href='#f1075' class='c008'><sup>[1075]</sup></a>. The Christian account also
narrates that in</p>

<p class='c009'>“the Paradise which is called the Cosmos [Qy the ‘heavenly’
earth or the Sun?], there are trees such as Desire and other deceits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>whereby the minds of those men [those who reach it?] are corrupted.
But the tree in Paradise, whereby they know the good, is Jesus and
the knowledge of Him which is in the Cosmos. And whoso receives
it, distinguishes between good and evil. Yet the Cosmos itself is
not of God, but it was made from portions of matter, and therefore
all things in it will disappear<a id='r1076'></a><a href='#f1076' class='c008'><sup>[1076]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There is not really any very great difference between this and
the Mahommedan tradition quoted above which makes Jesus
the messenger sent from above to give knowledge to Adam,
especially if we consider that Manes probably, like most of the
Gnostics, placed Paradise not upon the earth but in one of the
heavens intermediate between us and the abode of the Supreme
Being<a id='r1077'></a><a href='#f1077' class='c008'><sup>[1077]</sup></a>. That Manes supposed Jesus to have descended to this
earth also is plain from his own words quoted by Al Bîrûnî
from the <i>Shapurakan</i> or book written by Manes for King Sapor:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wisdom and deeds have always from time to time been brought to
mankind by the messenger of God. So in one age they have been
brought by the messenger called Buddha to India, in another by
Zaradusht [<i>i.e.</i> Zoroaster] to Persia, in another by Jesus to the
West. Thereupon this revelation has come down, this prophecy in
this last age through me, Mânî, the messenger of the God of Truth to
Babylonia<a id='r1078'></a><a href='#f1078' class='c008'><sup>[1078]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Manes’ ideas as to the salvation of man’s soul again differ
little in the two streams of tradition. The Christian, here
perhaps the fuller of the two, describes him as teaching that the
soul of man, as also that of beasts, birds, other animals, and
plants, is part of the light which was won by the demons from
the First Man, while all bodies are of that matter which is the
same as darkness. Man’s body, we are told, is called a cosmos
by parallelism with the great Cosmos, and all men have roots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>here below bound to things which are above<a id='r1079'></a><a href='#f1079' class='c008'><sup>[1079]</sup></a>. It is the cutting
of these roots by the demons which causes death. On the death
of a man who has attained the knowledge of the truth during
this life, his soul is taken up in the wheel to the Sun, by whom
after it has been purified it is passed over to the Moon, the two
luminaries being represented as ships or ferry-boats sailing to-and-fro
in the upper air. When the Moon is full, she ferries
the souls with which she is filled towards the East, and then
delivers them to the Aeons of Light who place them in the
Pillar of Glory before described. She then returns for a fresh
supply greatly reduced in circumference, whereby her waxing
and waning is explained<a id='r1080'></a><a href='#f1080' class='c008'><sup>[1080]</sup></a>. In the case of a man who has not
attained the knowledge of the truth, a small portion of the
soul only is purified and is then reincarnated in the body of
a dog, a camel, or some other animal, according to the sins
which it has committed. Thus, if he has killed a mouse, he will
become a mouse, if a chicken a chicken, and so on, while those
who have been employed in the reaping of corn will themselves
become corn or some other kind of plant in order that they may
be reaped and cut in turn. The soul of the homicide will, it
is said, go to inhabit the body of a leper<a id='r1081'></a><a href='#f1081' class='c008'><sup>[1081]</sup></a>. There will, apparently,
be five of these reincarnations<a id='r1082'></a><a href='#f1082' class='c008'><sup>[1082]</sup></a>, and between them the soul which
has not found knowledge of the truth is given over to the demons
in order that they may subdue it in the “Gehennas” of fire.
This, like its transference into other bodies, is for the sake of
teaching it better; but if it still remains without knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>it is cast into the great fire until the Consummation of the
World<a id='r1083'></a><a href='#f1083' class='c008'><sup>[1083]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mahommedan tradition as to what occurs at death goes
into more details, and it is here that we catch the first glimpse of
that doctrine of predestination which plays so prominent a part
in the later teaching of the Manichaean Church. When a just
or perfect or “true” Manichaean is on the point of death, the
First Man sends to him a “shining god of light” in the form of
“the Wise Guide” accompanied by three other gods and with
them “the bowl of water, the garment, the fillet for the head,
the circlet and the crown of light<a id='r1084'></a><a href='#f1084' class='c008'><sup>[1084]</sup></a>.” With them comes the
virgin who is like to the soul of the just one. There also appear
to him the devil of greed, that of pleasure, and others with
them. Directly the just one who is dying sees them, he calls
to his help the goddess<a id='r1085'></a><a href='#f1085' class='c008'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> who has taken the form of the Wise
Guide and the three gods her companions. They draw near to
him, and at the sight of them the devils turn and flee. Then
the gods take the just one, do on him the crowns and the
garment, put in his hand the bowl of water, and mount with
him to the Column of Praises in the sphere of the Moon, to the
First Man and to Nahnaha the Mother of Life, until they reach
the place in the Paradise of Light he occupied in the beginning<a id='r1086'></a><a href='#f1086' class='c008'><sup>[1086]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>His body remains stretched (upon the earth) in order that the
Sun, the Moon, and the Gods of Light may take from it its
powers, <i>i.e.</i> the Water, the Fire, the gentle Breeze, which are
then borne upwards to the Sun and become a god. The rest
of the body, which is all darkness, is cast into hell<a id='r1087'></a><a href='#f1087' class='c008'><sup>[1087]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This description of the lot of the blessed after death is
certainly taken from no other source than that from which the
Zoroastrian books put forth by the Sassanian kings are drawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the end of the third night,” says the Hatoxt Nask<a id='r1088'></a><a href='#f1088' class='c008'><sup>[1088]</sup></a>, one of the
earliest Zoroastrian documents that have come down to us, “at the
dawn of day, the soul of the faithful thinks that it is in a garden and
smells its perfumes. Towards it a wind seems to blow from the
region of the South perfumed, more perfumed than any other wind.
Then the soul of the faithful thinks that he breathes this wind with
his nostrils. ‘Whence blows this wind, the most perfumed that I
have breathed with my nostrils?’ While encountering this breeze,
his religion (conscience, <i>daena</i>, spiritual life), appears to him in the
form of a beautiful young girl, shining, with white arms, robust, of
fair growth, of fair aspect, tall, high-bosomed, of fair body, noble,
of shining race, with the figure of one who is 15 years old, as fair in
form as the fairest creatures that exist. Then the soul of the faithful
speaks to her, and asks ‘What virgin art thou, thou the most beautiful
in form of the virgins that I have ever seen?’ Then she who is his
religion answers: ‘O youth of good mind, of good words, of good
deeds, of good religion, I am thine own religion incarnate<a id='r1089'></a><a href='#f1089' class='c008'><sup>[1089]</sup></a>.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, too, the Vendidad, which may be a little later in
date than the document just quoted, represents Ahura Mazda
as saying in answer to Zarathustra himself:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“After a man has disappeared, after a man dies, the impious and
malevolent demons make their attack. When the dawn of the third
night shines forth and the day begins to lighten, the well-armed
Mithra arrives at the mountains giving forth holy radiance and the
Sun rises. Then, O Spitama Zarathustra ... she comes, the beautiful,
the well-made, the strong, of fair growth, with her dogs, full of
discernment, rich in children [<i>i.e.</i> fruitful], the longed-for, virtuous
one. She leads the souls of the faithful above the Hara Berezaiti;
she sustains them across the bridge Chinvat in the road of the spiritual
divinities. Vohu Mano rises from his golden throne. Vohu Mano
says, ‘O faithful one, how hast thou come hither from the perishable
world to the imperishable?’ Rejoicing, the faithful pass before
Ahura Mazda, before the beneficent Immortals, before golden thrones,
before the house of hymns, the dwelling of Ahura Mazda, the dwelling
of the beneficent Immortals, the dwelling of the other faithful ones.
When the faithful is purified, the wicked and malevolent demons
tremble by reason of the perfume after his departure as a sheep
pursued by a wolf trembles at the [scent of the?] wolf<a id='r1090'></a><a href='#f1090' class='c008'><sup>[1090]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To return, however, to the Mahommedan account of Manes’
doctrine. This last by no means confined his survey of the
state of man’s soul after death to the single case of the justified
dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When death draws nigh to a man who has fought for religion
and justice, [he is represented as saying,] and who has protected
them by protecting the Just, the gods whom I have mentioned
appear and the devils are there also. Then he calls the gods to his
help and seeks to win them by showing to them his works of piety,
and that which he has done to protect the religion and the Just.
The gods deliver him from the devils, while leaving him in the
condition of a man in this world, who sees fearful shapes in his
dreams, and who is plunged in dirt and mud<a id='r1091'></a><a href='#f1091' class='c008'><sup>[1091]</sup></a>. He remains in this
state until his Light and his Spirit are freed [evidently by transmigration]
when he arrives at the meeting-place of the Just. Then,
after having wandered for long, he dons their vesture. But when
death appears to the sinful man, to him who has been ruled by greed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and desire, the devils draw near to him, they seize him, torment
him, and put fearful shapes before his eyes. The gods are there
also with the vesture, so that the sinful one thinks they have come
to deliver him. But they have only appeared to him to reproach
him, to remind him of his actions, and to convince him of his guilt
in having neglected the support of the Just. He wanders unceasingly
throughout the world, and is tortured until the coming of the End
of the World, when he will be thrown into hell. Thus, Manes
teaches,” continues the tradition, “that there are three paths for
the soul of man. One leads to Paradise, which is the path of the
Just. Another leads back to the world and its terrors, which is
the path of the protectors of the faith and the helpers of the Just.
The third leads to hell, which is the path of the sinful man<a id='r1092'></a><a href='#f1092' class='c008'><sup>[1092]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet there is nothing to show that the sins which thus doom a
man to hell are within his choice to commit or to leave alone
as he chooses. Rather does it appear that his freedom from
sin depends on the admixture of light which enters into his
composition at his birth. Of all this the Christian tradition
says nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, nevertheless, in the division here set forth of the
adherents of the religion into the Just and the protectors of
the Just, that the great distinction between the Manichaean
religion and all its contemporaries appears. Both traditions
are agreed that those who listen to the teaching of Manes are
to be divided into five classes, viz. the Masters who are the
sons of Gentleness; those who are enlightened by the Sun, who
are the sons of Knowledge or the Priests; the Elders who are
the sons of Intelligence; the Just who are the sons of Discretion;
and the Hearers who are the sons of Discernment<a id='r1093'></a><a href='#f1093' class='c008'><sup>[1093]</sup></a>. The first
three classes we may safely neglect for the present, as they
evidently correspond to the three superior or directing orders
of the Manichaean Church to which we shall have to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>later; but the last two, the Just and the Hearers, give us the
key to the organization of the sect, and explain how it was
able to maintain itself for so long against its numerous enemies.
He who would enter into the religion, says the Mahommedan
tradition, must examine himself that he may see whether he
is strong enough to conquer desire and greed, to abstain from
meats, from wine, and from marriage, to avoid all that can be
hurtful in (to?) water or fire, and to shun magic and hypocrisy<a id='r1094'></a><a href='#f1094' class='c008'><sup>[1094]</sup></a>.
These abstinences are those that are demanded of the perfect
Manichaeans, who have been called above the Just or the
Sons of Discretion, and who with their superiors constitute the
Manichaean Church. These are they whom the Christian tradition
speaks of as the Elect, and for whom, as we have seen, there
is reserved after death a glorious ascension and an immediate
return to the Paradise of Light. So Valentinus, like many other
Gnostics, divided Christians into the two classes of pneumatics
and psychics, the first-named of whom were to occupy a more
distinguished position in the world to come than the other.
There is nothing to show, however, that Valentinus or any other
Gnostic ever imposed any discipline on the pneumatics than that
prescribed for the psychics, or that he thought that those who
were going to take a higher rank in the next world should
observe a stricter mode of life in this. The Catholics, indeed,
had already adopted the view that the celibate member of the
Church possessed “a higher calling” than his married brethren;
but there is no reason to suppose that they therefore assigned
to them a higher place in the next world, or thought that those
who had not the gift of continence were to be permitted any
relaxation of the moral law imposed upon celibate and married
alike. It is therefore probable that it was from Buddhism,
with which Manes must have made himself well acquainted
during his journeys into India, that he borrowed the scheme
by which those who believed in the truth of his teaching could
delay subjecting themselves to the austerities necessary for
salvation until their next incarnation.</p>

<p class='c007'>However this may be, there can be little doubt that this is
the meaning of the position he assigned to the Hearers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“If,” he says according to the Mahommedan author, “he who
would enter into the religion does <i>not</i> feel strong enough to practise
the abstinences before enumerated, let him renounce the attempt.
If, however, he is filled with love for the faith, yet cannot conquer
desire and greed, let him seek to progress by protecting the faith
and the Just, and let him fight against evil actions on the occasions
when he can give himself to labour<a id='r1095'></a><a href='#f1095' class='c008'><sup>[1095]</sup></a>, piety, vigilance, prayer and
humility. This will fill him with contentment both in this ephemeral
world, and in the eternal world to come, and he will put on the
body of the second degree in the state which follows after death<a id='r1096'></a><a href='#f1096' class='c008'><sup>[1096]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Unless they are greatly belied, some of his later followers
looked upon this as a licence to the Hearers to commit such
sins as they chose<a id='r1097'></a><a href='#f1097' class='c008'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> in this life, yet it is evident that this
formed no part of Manes’ original teaching. He imposed upon
the Hearers, says the Mahommedan tradition, ten commandments,
which were: to abstain from prayers offered to idols,
from lying, from avarice, from murder, from adultery, from
false teaching, from magic, from double dealing, from doubt
in religion and from slackness and want of energy in action.
They also had to recite certain prayers which will be mentioned
in their place, and to fast two days when the Moon is new
as when she is full, as also when the Sun enters the sign
of Sagittary. A three days’ fast was also obligatory on the
first appearance of the Moon after the entry of the Sun into
the signs of Capricorn and of Libra. But they were to feast
on Sunday, a day which the Perfect, according to the
Mahommedans, kept as a fast, their own weekly feast being
held on Monday<a id='r1098'></a><a href='#f1098' class='c008'><sup>[1098]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attitude of Manes to other religions was also without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>precedent or parallel. Of the Jews and of their religion he
seems to have had a detestation so strong and so deeply rooted
that it is difficult not to see in it some connection with political
events of which we have lost the record. The war of extermination
which Hadrian had been forced to wage against the
Jews of Palestine must have been over nearly a century before
Manes began to teach; but the Babylonian Jews can hardly
have been affected by this, and the story of the king of Adiabene
quoted above shows that shortly before the time of Ardeshîr
they actively pursued the proselytizing policy which their
countrymen in the West had been forced to abandon. In
doing so, they doubtless contrived, after their manner, to
offend the national prejudices of their hosts, while showing
themselves greedy, as ever, of political power<a id='r1099'></a><a href='#f1099' class='c008'><sup>[1099]</sup></a>. This probably
provoked reprisals, and it is quite possible that Manes’ teaching
derived some of its strength from the revulsion felt by Ardeshîr’s
Aryan subjects to the borrowings from Judaism to be found
both in Mithraism and the Avestic literature. But whatever
its cause, there can be no doubt about the hatred felt by
Manes for the Jewish religion, which is prominent in every tradition
of his teaching. The earlier Gnostics, like Marcion, had
made the God of the Old Testament a harsh but just and well-meaning
tyrant; but Manes would have none of this, and
declared that he was a fiend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the Prince of Darkness,” the Christian tradition makes him
say, “who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and their priests. Thus the
Christians, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error
when they worship this God. For he led them astray in the
lusts that he taught them, since he was not the God of Truth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Whence those who put their hope in that God who spoke with Moses
and the Prophets will be bound with him, because they have not
put their trust in the God of Truth. For he, the God of the Jews,
spoke with them according to their lusts<a id='r1100'></a><a href='#f1100' class='c008'><sup>[1100]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a very different spirit, however, Manes dealt with all the
other religions that he knew. He acknowledged the Divine
origin of the teachings of Zoroaster, of Buddha, and of Jesus
alike, with the reservation that he should himself be regarded
as the Paraclete, which here seems to mean nothing more than
the Legate or Ambassador, sent by the Good God to complete
their teaching. “Mânî, the messenger of the God of Truth to
Babylonia<a id='r1101'></a><a href='#f1101' class='c008'><sup>[1101]</sup></a>” is the title which, as we have seen, he gives
himself in the most authentic record of his teaching. He
aimed, in short, at establishing a universal religion which
should include within its scope the three faiths that between
them commanded the allegiance of the whole civilized world,
and should acknowledge him as its founder and chief. Had
his plans come to fruition in his lifetime, he would have
attained an empire over the minds of men far greater and
wider than any ever claimed or dreamed of by the most
ambitious of the Roman pontiffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The full details of the way in which he proposed to establish
this new faith we shall probably never know; but discoveries
made during the last decade have shown us that his plans were
well fitted to their purpose. The successive expeditions of
Drs Grünwedel and von Le Coq to Turfan have shown that up
to as late as the <abbr title='eleventh'><span class='fss'>XI</span>th</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, there was still a strong body
of Manichaeans probably belonging to the Ouigur nation in
Chinese Turkestan, living apparently in complete amity with
their Buddhist countrymen<a id='r1102'></a><a href='#f1102' class='c008'><sup>[1102]</sup></a>. The writings that were there
discovered, to which we shall have to refer more in detail later,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>are mostly written in a script resembling the Estranghelo or
Syriac but with an alphabet peculiar to the Manichaean
religious documents, and which cannot, one would think, have
been adopted by those who used it for any other purpose than
that of concealment<a id='r1103'></a><a href='#f1103' class='c008'><sup>[1103]</sup></a>. Judging from this and the practice of
the sect in Europe from the time of Diocletian onward, it
seems highly probable that among Buddhists, the Manichaean
hearers professed Buddhism, and among Zoroastrians, Zoroastrianism,
hoping that thus they might be able to turn their
fellows to their way of thinking without openly dissenting from
the reigning religion. The persecution that Bahram I instituted
against them immediately upon Manes’ execution was
perhaps less a reason than a pretext for this.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is certainly borne out by their proceedings when they
found themselves among Christians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ask me if I believe the gospel,” said the Manichaean Prefect,
Faustus, in his dispute with <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine (himself for nine years
before his conversion a Manichaean Hearer). “My obedience to its
commands shows that I do. I should rather ask you if you believe
it, since you give no proof of your belief. I have left my father,
brother, wife and children and all else that the gospel requires; and
you ask me if I believe the gospel. Perhaps you do not know what
is called the gospel. The gospel is nothing else than the teaching
and the precept of Christ. I have parted with all gold and silver.
I have left off carrying money in my purse; content with food
obtained from day to day; without anxiety for the morrow and
without care as to how I shall be fed or wherewithal I shall be
clothed; and you ask if I believe the gospel? You see in me the
blessings of the gospel; and yet you ask if I believe the gospel.
You see me poor, meek, a peacemaker, pure in heart, mourning,
hungering, thirsting, bearing persecutions and hatred for righteousness’
sake; and do you doubt if I believe in the gospel<a id='r1104'></a><a href='#f1104' class='c008'><sup>[1104]</sup></a>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, too, Manes in the epistle to Marcellus which, although much
altered and corrupted by its Catholic transcribers, is probably
a genuine document, is careful to begin in language which seems
imitated from the Epistles of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Manes, an apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints who are with
me, and the virgins, to Marcellus, my beloved son; Grace, mercy,
and peace be with you from God the Father, and from our Lord
Jesus Christ; and may the right hand of light preserve you from
the present evil world and from its calamities, and from the snares
of the wicked one, Amen<a id='r1105'></a><a href='#f1105' class='c008'><sup>[1105]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While in the Disputation which follows and which is certainly
a later interpolation, or possibly a concoction of some later
author, he is represented as saying “My brother, I am indeed
a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus.” Yet
in spite of this and a few other passages of the same kind, it
is plain that neither Manes, nor any of those who believed on
his teaching, were Christians in any sense in which the term
could not be applied to the followers of Mahommed or many
another professedly anti-Christian teacher. Manes entirely rejected
the account of the Incarnation given in the Gospels,
alleging, as a modern critic might do, that it was not the account
of eyewitnesses, but a mass of fables which had grown up
after the memory of the events recorded had faded away<a id='r1106'></a><a href='#f1106' class='c008'><sup>[1106]</sup></a>.
Jesus, he said, was not born of woman, but came forth from
the Father or First Man, and descended from heaven in the
form of a man about thirty years of age<a id='r1107'></a><a href='#f1107' class='c008'><sup>[1107]</sup></a>. But the body in
which He appeared was an illusion only and was no more that
of a real man than the dove which descended upon Him at the
baptism in Jordan was a real dove, and it was not true to say
that He was put to death by the Romans and suffered on the
cross<a id='r1108'></a><a href='#f1108' class='c008'><sup>[1108]</sup></a>. So far from that being the case, he declared that Jesus,
the mortal or suffering Jesus, was nothing but the universal
soul diffused throughout Nature and thus tormented by its
association with matter. Thus, he said, the Jesus <i>patibilis</i> may
be said to be hanging from every tree<a id='r1109'></a><a href='#f1109' class='c008'><sup>[1109]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>To say that such teaching was likely to alter in the course
of a generation or two is merely to assert that it followed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>course of evolution which can be traced in all religions, and it
is possible that in what has been said in the last paragraph
concerning Jesus, we have rather the opinions of the Manichaeans
of the fourth century than those of Manes himself. Yet even
in this we see exemplified the chameleon-like habit peculiar to
the Manichaeans of modifying their tenets in outward appearance
so as to make them coincide as nearly as possible with the
views of those whom they wished to win over to them. Thus
when the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, the Three Persons
and One God, began to take shape under the pressure of the
Arian controversy, the Manichaeans were not long in matching
it with a Trinity of their own<a id='r1110'></a><a href='#f1110' class='c008'><sup>[1110]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We worship,” said Faustus the Manichaean Perfect, “under the
triple appellation of Almighty God, the Father and His Son Christ
and the Holy Spirit. While these are one and the same, we believe
also that the Father properly dwells in the highest or chief light, which
Paul calls ‘light inaccessible,’ and the Son in the second or visible
light. And as the Son is himself two-fold according to the apostle,
who speaks of Christ as the power of God and the wisdom of God, so
we believe that His power dwells in the Sun and His wisdom in the
Moon<a id='r1111'></a><a href='#f1111' class='c008'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>. We also believe that the Holy Spirit, the third majesty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>has His seat and His home in the whole circle of the atmosphere.<a id='r1112'></a><a href='#f1112' class='c008'><sup>[1112]</sup></a>
By His influence and inpouring of the spirit, the Earth conceives and
brings forth the suffering Jesus, who, as hanging from every tree,
is the life and salvation of man<a id='r1113'></a><a href='#f1113' class='c008'><sup>[1113]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In like manner, while not denying them in terms, the Manichaeans
attempted to refine away all the significance of the
Crucifixion and the Atonement, by representing them as merely
symbolical. In one Apocryphal book called the <i>Wanderings of
the Apostles</i>, which seems to be of Manichaean origin, Jesus
appears to <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John, who is sunk in grief at the supposed
sufferings of his Master, and tells him that His Crucifixion was
a mere phantasmagoria or miracle-play performed to impress
the plebeian crowd at Jerusalem. Then He vanishes and in His
stead appears a cross of pure light, surrounded by a multitude
of other forms representing the same shape and image. From
this cross comes a Divine voice saying sweetly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cross of light is, for your sakes, sometimes called the Word,
sometimes Christ; sometimes the Door, sometimes the Way;
sometimes the Bread, sometimes the Sun; sometimes the Resurrection,
sometimes Jesus; sometimes the Father, sometimes the Spirit;
sometimes the Life, sometimes the Truth; sometimes Faith and
sometimes Grace<a id='r1114'></a><a href='#f1114' class='c008'><sup>[1114]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As will presently be seen, now that we have under our hands
the writings of Manichaean communities domiciled in Persian
and Chinese territory, we find in them similar compromises
with the faiths of Zoroaster and Buddha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet after the Mahommedan conquest of Asia, and in regions
where they were free, as it would seem, from the pressure of
their Zoroastrian and Christian competitors, the Manichaeans
appear to have evolved a theology as formal and as detailed
as any of the Gnostic systems which we have examined. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>is in the main set out by Theodore Bar Khôni, the Nestorian
Bishop of Kashgar, in his <i>Book of Scholia</i> written in Syriac and
Mandaean which has been in part translated by the scholarly
care of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Pognon, late Consul of France at Aleppo, and has lately
been commentated by <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Pognon at first identified
Bar Khôni with the nephew of the Nestorian Patriarch Iwannis
(Johannes or John), whose reign began in 893 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, and he
quoted Assemani’s <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis</i> in his support<a id='r1115'></a><a href='#f1115' class='c008'><sup>[1115]</sup></a>.
Later, however, he withdrew this, and put him a century
earlier<a id='r1116'></a><a href='#f1116' class='c008'><sup>[1116]</sup></a>. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, on the other hand, thinks that Bar
Khôni lived at the end of the <abbr title='sixth'><span class='fss'>VI</span>th</abbr> century or the beginning
of the <abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr>, and therefore before the Mahommedan invasion<a id='r1117'></a><a href='#f1117' class='c008'><sup>[1117]</sup></a>.
In any event, the <i>Scholia</i> describe a body of Manichaean
doctrine considerably later in date than any of the Christian
sources hitherto referred to, and probably formed in an atmosphere
where the necessity for outward conformity to either the
Zoroastrian or the Christian faith was a good deal less cogent
than it was further west. Its agreement with the Mahommedan
tradition drawn from above is also well marked, and it derives
much support from the Manichaean <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> lately recovered from
the oasis of Turfan in Turkestan, and in that of Tun-huang in
China. It is possible, although no proofs are yet forthcoming,
that it was this Neo-Manichaeism, as it has been called, that
inspired the Manichaean sectaries who were imported in the
<abbr title='ninth'><span class='fss'>IX</span>th</abbr> and <abbr title='tenth'><span class='fss'>X</span>th</abbr> centuries into Bulgaria, whence their missionaries
found their way later into Italy, France, and other countries of
Southern Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system disclosed in these documents begins, as does
nearly every Manichaean writing, with the assertion of the
existence of two gods, that is to say, the God of Light and the
God of Darkness. As the Kingdom of Darkness, whenever and
wherever described, is the exact opposite and counterpart of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>that of the Light, we shall not return to it again, but assume
that in describing the one we are <span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span> describing
the other. The God of Light has one substance of which all
the powers of light were made, but three forms or hypostases,
called in the Greek Formula of abjuration “faces” or persons,
which added to his own personality make a supreme tetrad.
These three hypostases are his wisdom, power, and goodness,
by which is probably meant that he operates in the lower
powers through these qualities, while remaining himself remote
in the “inaccessible light<a id='r1118'></a><a href='#f1118' class='c008'><sup>[1118]</sup></a>.” He possesses also five houses or
dwellings, which are also called his worlds and even his members.
Their names according to Bar Khôni are Intelligence, Knowledge,
Thought, Reflexion, and Feeling<a id='r1119'></a><a href='#f1119' class='c008'><sup>[1119]</sup></a>. These seem to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>ranged in this order below the dwelling of the inaccessible light,
so as to cut off all approach to it by a fivefold wall. On the
attack of the powers of darkness before mentioned, the God of
Light, called by Bar Khôni the Father of Greatness, that is
to say, the Very Great or Greatest<a id='r1120'></a><a href='#f1120' class='c008'><sup>[1120]</sup></a>, creates by his word the
Mother of Life, who in her turn evokes the First Man as already
described. Thus is constituted, if <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont be right, the
First Triad of Father, Mother, and Son<a id='r1121'></a><a href='#f1121' class='c008'><sup>[1121]</sup></a>. From the Turfan
documents, we know that the Father was called, in Turkestan
at any rate, by the name of Azrua or Zervan, and the Son
Khormizta or Ormuzd<a id='r1122'></a><a href='#f1122' class='c008'><sup>[1122]</sup></a>. As for the appellation of the Mother
we are still in ignorance<a id='r1123'></a><a href='#f1123' class='c008'><sup>[1123]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>When the First Man or Ormuzd marched against his enemy,
he also evoked five elements called sometimes his sons and
sometimes his members. These are the Ether, the Wind, the
Light, the Water, and the Fire before mentioned, which together
compose the soul of the world, and hence of man, who is in
every respect its image. When he was conquered by Satan
and dragged down to the lowest pit of hell, he prayed, says Bar
Khôni, seven times to the Very Great Father, and he in compassion
created, again by his word, the Friend of the Lights<a id='r1124'></a><a href='#f1124' class='c008'><sup>[1124]</sup></a>,
who evoked the Great Ban<a id='r1125'></a><a href='#f1125' class='c008'><sup>[1125]</sup></a>, who evoked the Living Spirit.
Here we have the second triad or “second creation,” of which,
as has been said, only the last member takes any active part
in what follows. As we have already seen, the Living Spirit
speaks a word like a sharp sword, and the image of the First
Man answers<a id='r1126'></a><a href='#f1126' class='c008'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> and is drawn up out of hell. These two, the
sword or Appellant and the image or Respondent, together
mount towards the Mother of Life and the Living Spirit, and
the Mother of Life “clothes” the Image—no doubt with a form
or “nature,”—while the Living Spirit does the same with the
compelling word<a id='r1127'></a><a href='#f1127' class='c008'><sup>[1127]</sup></a>. Then they return to the earth of darkness
where remains the soul of the First Man in the shape of his
five sons.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>In the meantime, the Living Spirit has also given birth to
five sons. He, like the Very Great Father of whom he is perhaps
the reflexion, has five worlds named like those of his paradigm
from which he draws certain other powers. From his Intelligence,
says Bar Khôni, he produces The Ornament of Splendour,
who is none other than the Splenditenens we have seen drawing
the heavens after him; from his Reason, the Great King of
Honour, who is described as sitting in the midst of the celestial
armies; from his Thought, Adamas of the Light armed with
shield and spear; from his Reflexion the King of Glory whose
function is to set in motion the three wheels of the fire, the
water, and the wind, which apparently raise to the upper
spheres the portions of those elements still left below; and
finally from his Feeling the great Omophorus or Atlas who
bears the earths on his shoulders<a id='r1128'></a><a href='#f1128' class='c008'><sup>[1128]</sup></a>. Immediately on evocation,
three of these powers were set to work to kill and flay the rulers
of darkness, and to carry their skins to the Mother of Life. She
stretches out the skins to make the sky, thereby fashioning ten
or eleven or even twelve heavens. She throws their bodies on to
the Earth of Darkness, thereby forming eight earths<a id='r1129'></a><a href='#f1129' class='c008'><sup>[1129]</sup></a>. Thus the
soul or sons of the First Man are rescued from the Powers of
Darkness, and the machinery of the redemption of the Light is
set on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, a third act to the drama. Again, the
lesser Powers of Light, this time the Mother of Life, the First
Man, and the Living Spirit, cry to the Very Great Father.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Satan, or, as the Mahommedan tradition calls him, Hummâma,
is still in existence, although his “sons,” the Rulers of Darkness,
the Hot Wind, the Smoke, and the others have been crucified
or fixed in the firmament, and he is still actively working with
his remaining powers against the Light. The Light-Powers
feel themselves contaminated and oppressed by the contact,
and perhaps even in some fear lest they should again have the
worst in a renewal of the conflict. Again, the Very Great Father
hears them and sends to their assistance a third creation, called
this time simply the Messenger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who this Messenger is, is the main puzzle of the new
documents. The author of the <i>Acta</i> knew something of him,
for he speaks of a “Third Legate,” who, when the world is
burning in the great conflagration which will mark the
redemption of the last particles of light, will be found in the
Ship of the Moon with Jesus, the Mother of Life, the Virgin of
Light and the twelve other powers to be presently mentioned<a id='r1130'></a><a href='#f1130' class='c008'><sup>[1130]</sup></a>.
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, in his able analysis of Bar Khôni’s system, thinks
that this “Third Legate” resembles the Neryôsang of the
Persians, who in the later Mazdean literature is made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>herald of Ormuzd, and has also features in common with
Gayômort the First Man, and Mithras<a id='r1131'></a><a href='#f1131' class='c008'><sup>[1131]</sup></a>. But it is plain from
the Tun-huang treatise lately discovered, as well as from the
fragments found at Turfan, that the Third Legate corresponds
most closely to the Mazdean genius or divinity Sraôsha, the
angel of Obedience<a id='r1132'></a><a href='#f1132' class='c008'><sup>[1132]</sup></a>. Sraôsha is described in the Srôsh Yashts
as the “Holy and Strong Srôsh,” “the Incarnate Word, a
mighty-speared and lordly god.” He it is who is called the
“fiend-smiter,” who is said to watch over the world and to
defend it from the demons, especially at night, to fight for the
souls of the good after death, and, in the older Mazdean traditions,
to judge the dead with Mithra and Rashnu as his
assessors, like Rhadamanthos, Minos, and Eacus among the
Greeks<a id='r1133'></a><a href='#f1133' class='c008'><sup>[1133]</sup></a>. In the Turfan texts he is called the mighty, and in
the Tun-huang treatise is likened to a judge, while in both sets
of documents he has his proper appellation of Srôsh<a id='r1134'></a><a href='#f1134' class='c008'><sup>[1134]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This third creation was no more content than his two
predecessors to enter upon the task allotted to him without
further help. His first act upon arriving hither, according to
Bar Khôni, was to evoke or call into existence twelve virgins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>with their vestures, their crowns, and their guards. The
Turfan texts give us the names of these powers, four of whom
seem to be attributes of sovereignty, and eight of them virtues.
Their names in the order of the new texts are respectively,
Dominion, Wisdom, Victory, Persuasion, Purity, Truth, Faith,
Patience, Uprightness, Goodness, Justice and Light, and they
are probably the twelve “pilots” whom the <i>Acta</i> describe as being
at the Ecpyrosis in the Moon-ship with their father, with Jesus,
and with the other powers<a id='r1135'></a><a href='#f1135' class='c008'><sup>[1135]</sup></a>. But there is much plausibility in
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont’s theory that this Third Legate or Srôsh is supposed
until that event to inhabit the Sun, and that his 12 “daughters”
are the signs of the Zodiac among whom he moves<a id='r1136'></a><a href='#f1136' class='c008'><sup>[1136]</sup></a>. According
to Bar Khôni, it is the same Legate who is ordered by the Great
Ban to create a new earth and to set the whole celestial
machinery—the Sun and Moon-ships and the three wheels of
fire, air, and water—in motion<a id='r1137'></a><a href='#f1137' class='c008'><sup>[1137]</sup></a>. Yet we hear nothing in any
other document of any addition to the number of eight earths
already created, and we can only therefore suppose that Bar
Khôni’s phrase refers to the gradual purification of this world
of ours by Srôsh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bar Khôni also makes the appearance of this last Legate
responsible for the appearance of man upon the earth, as to
which he recites a story which seems at first sight to be an
elaboration of the Gnostic and Manichaean tradition preserved
by the Christians and mentioned above. The Legate, he makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Manes say, was of both sexes, and on his appearance in the
Sun-ship, both the male and female rulers of Darkness became
so filled with desire that they began to give up the light which
they had taken from the sons of the First Man. With this was
mingled their own sin, half of which fell into the sea and there
gave birth to a horrible monster like the King of Darkness.
This was conquered and slain by Adamas of the Light, but that
which fell upon the land fructified as the five kinds of trees<a id='r1138'></a><a href='#f1138' class='c008'><sup>[1138]</sup></a>.
Moreover, the female demons, who were pregnant at the time,
miscarried and their untimely births ate of the buds of the
trees. Yet these females remembered the beauty of the Legate
whom they had seen, and Asaqlun or Saclas<a id='r1139'></a><a href='#f1139' class='c008'><sup>[1139]</sup></a>, son of the King
of Darkness, persuaded them to give him their sons and
daughters, in order that he might make from them an image of
the Legate. This they did, when he ate the male children and
his wife Namraël consumed the female. In consequence
Namraël gave birth to a son and a daughter who were called
Adam and Eve. Jesus was sent to Adam and found him sleeping
a sleep of death, but awoke him, made him stand upright,
and gave him to eat of the Tree of Life, while he separated him
from his too seductive companion. This story is not confirmed
by any of the new documents; and in the present state of our
knowledge it is impossible to say whether it contains an old
Asiatic tradition, of which the Biblical accounts of the protoplasts
and of the Sons of God making love to the daughters of
men are the only remnants which have till now come down to
us, or whether—as is at least as likely—the whole story is a
blend by the Manichaeans of Jewish, Mandaite, and Pagan
legends. The main point in it for our consideration is its
introduction of a Jesus who is certainly not the same as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Jesus <i>patibilis</i> whom <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine and the other Christian
Fathers make Manes describe as born of the Living Spirit and
the Earth, and as hanging on every tree. This other Jesus,
who came to the earth in the time of Adam, is a fourth emissary
or Saviour put forth by the second and third creations according
to the <i>Fihrist</i> and called by Bar Khôni “Jesus the shining one.”
In the Turfan texts he is, as has been said, perhaps equated
with the Virgin of Light, and in the Tun-huang treatise he is
spoken of as “Jesus the Victorious<a id='r1140'></a><a href='#f1140' class='c008'><sup>[1140]</sup></a>.” Evidently he is conceived
as one of the Burkhans or Buddhas who fight against
the Powers of Darkness, and the Jesus <i>patibilis</i> is but another
name for the fragments of light or “armour” of the First Man
left on this earth. The borrowing of the name revered among
Christians is but one of the compromises by which the Manichaeans
hoped to draw those of other faiths into their net.</p>

<p class='c007'>A like plasticity is shown in the organization of the Manichaean
Church. The first disciples of Manes, to whom he gave
special commandments, were, according to Christian tradition,
only seven in number, in which if anywhere in the system we
may see a reflexion of the seven Amshaspands of the Avesta<a id='r1141'></a><a href='#f1141' class='c008'><sup>[1141]</sup></a>.
But later there seems to have been instituted a band of twelve
Apostles in manifest imitation of the Apostles of Jesus, who
perhaps corresponded to the Masters or highest degree that we
have seen called the Sons of Gentleness. These were presided
over by a Manichaean Pope who figured as the representative
and Vicegerent of Manes himself. There were also seventy-two
bishops answering to the seventy-two disciples of Christ, who are
perhaps to be identified with the Sons of Knowledge. Then
came the Presbyters or Sons of Intelligence whose functions were
chiefly those of missionaries and who were perpetually, like
Faustus, travelling for the propagation of the faith<a id='r1142'></a><a href='#f1142' class='c008'><sup>[1142]</sup></a>. This seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>to have been the organization generally adopted for Christian
countries, and we meet with it there up to a very late date.
Yet there is no reason to suppose that it was necessarily copied
by the Manichaeans of Central Asia or India, or that the
Manichaeans always obeyed some central authority. What
organization they did adopt outside Europe and Africa we shall
probably have to wait to discover when more of the documents
coming from Turkestan have been deciphered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extreme simplicity of the Manichaean ritual also made
easy to them all such adaptations to the ways of their neighbours.
Hating images with as much energy, perhaps, as
Zoroaster himself, they had neither statues nor lights nor
incense in their meeting-places, which must in the West have
been as bare and as unadorned as a Scottish conventicle. The
whole service seems to have consisted of hymns and prayers,
in the first of which the mythology of the sect doubtless found
expression, while the second mainly consisted of those praises
of the Powers of Light, which praises were thought, as has been
said, to have an actual and objective existence and thus to
fulfil a considerable part in the scheme of redemption. Up to
the present we have very few examples of the hymns. The
<i>Hymn of the Soul</i>, of which Prof. Bevan has published an English
translation, is probably Manichaean in origin<a id='r1143'></a><a href='#f1143' class='c008'><sup>[1143]</sup></a>, and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine
tells of a “love song” in which the Father, meaning thereby
probably Srôsh, the third legate<a id='r1144'></a><a href='#f1144' class='c008'><sup>[1144]</sup></a>, is represented as presiding at
a banquet crowned with flowers and bearing a sceptre, while
twelve gods, three from each quarter of the globe, are grouped
round him “clothed in flowers” singing praises and laying
flowers at his feet. These are said to represent the seasons<a id='r1145'></a><a href='#f1145' class='c008'><sup>[1145]</sup></a>;
and we hear also of myths doubtless expressed in song describing

Light still imprisoned in matter and who is always bewailing
their captivity<a id='r1146'></a><a href='#f1146' class='c008'><sup>[1146]</sup></a>; and of his fellow angel Omophorus who, as
has been said, bears the world on his shoulders like the classical
Atlas<a id='r1147'></a><a href='#f1147' class='c008'><sup>[1147]</sup></a>. Doubtless, too, some of these hymns described that
last conflagration, which seems to have occupied so great
a place in the speculations of the early Manichaeans, when the
justified faithful, secure in the two great ships which sail about
on the ocean of the upper air, shall behold the world in flames
and the last portion of the imprisoned Light mounting in the
Column of Praises, while Satan and his hosts are confined for
ever in the gross and dark matter which is henceforth to be
their portion<a id='r1148'></a><a href='#f1148' class='c008'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>. Possibly the Turfan discoveries may yet recover
for us some important fragments of this lost literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the prayers, we are a little better informed.
“Free us by thy skill, for we suffer here oppression and torture
and pollution, only that thou (the First Man?) mayest mourn
unmolested in thy kingdom,” is one of those which <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine
has preserved for us<a id='r1149'></a><a href='#f1149' class='c008'><sup>[1149]</sup></a>. So, too, the Mahommedan tradition has
handed down a series of six doxologies or hymns of praise out
of a total of twelve which seem to have been obligatory, perhaps
on all Manichaeans, but certainly on the Perfect. The suppliant
is, we are told, to stand upright, to wash in running water or
something else, in which we may perhaps see either the origin
or an imitation of the ceremonial ablutions of the Mussulman,
then to turn towards the Great Light, to prostrate himself and
to say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blessed be our guide, the Paraclete, the Messenger of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Light. Blessed be his angels, his guards, and highly praised
his shining troops.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he is to rise and, prostrating himself again, to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou highly-esteemed one, O thou shining Mânî our guide, thou
the root of illumination, branch of uprightness, thou the great tree,
thou who art the sovereign Remedy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A third prostration, and the praise runs:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I prostrate myself and praise with a pure heart and a sincere
tongue, the Great God, the Father of the Lights and of their elements,
the most highly praised, the glorified, thee and all thy Majesty and
thy blessed worlds that thou hast called forth! To praise thee is
to praise equally thy troops, thy justified ones, thy word, thy
majesty, thy good pleasure. For thou art the God who is all Truth,
all Life, and all Justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then comes a fourth prostration and the sentence:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I praise all the gods, all the shining angels, all the lights, and all
the troops who are from the Great God, and I prostrate myself before
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The speech after the fifth prostration is:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I prostrate myself and I praise the great troops, and the shining
gods who, with their Wisdom spread over the Darkness, pursue it
and conquer it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While the sixth, and last given in full, is simply:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I prostrate myself and I praise the Father of Majesty, the eminent
one, the shining one who has come forth from the two sciences<a id='r1150'></a><a href='#f1150' class='c008'><sup>[1150]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems fairly plain that these praises are addressed not
so much to the “King of the Paradise of Light” or Highest
God of Goodness as to the lesser Powers of Light. The recent
expeditions of European scholars to Central Asia have succeeded
in recovering for us almost in full the Confession-Prayer repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>ritually by the Manichaean Hearers or laymen which, besides
confirming the Christian and Mahommedan accounts of Manes’
teaching summarized above, shows a greater belief in the
efficacy of repentance and the enforcement of a stricter morality
upon all classes of Manichaeans than we should have imagined
from the accounts of their adversaries<a id='r1151'></a><a href='#f1151' class='c008'><sup>[1151]</sup></a>. We are fortunate in
possessing more than one text of this Confession-Prayer, that
found by the energy of our English emissary, Dr (now Sir Marc
Aurel) Stein, in the “Cave of the Thousand Buddhas” at Tun-huang,
proving almost identical with the one discovered in
Turfan by the Russian Expedition and now in <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Petersburg,
while both can be checked and supplemented by fragments also
found at Turfan by Profs. Grünwedel’s and von Le Coq’s
expeditions to the same place and taken to Berlin<a id='r1152'></a><a href='#f1152' class='c008'><sup>[1152]</sup></a>. The title
and first few lines of this prayer have been lost, owing to the
fact that the Chinese plan of writing on a continuous sheet of
paper many yards in length, which was then rolled up with the
last lines innermost, was adopted by its transcribers. All the
specimens yet found are in Turkish, the Russian <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> being in
the dialect called after the nation using it, Ouigour or Uighur,
and like that found by Dr Stein and the Berlin fragments, in
the Manichaean modification of the Estranghelo or Syriac
script. The prayer or litany is in 15 sections or classes, the
number having doubtless a mystical reference<a id='r1153'></a><a href='#f1153' class='c008'><sup>[1153]</sup></a>, and is followed
in the Russian and English examples by a recapitulation which
is not without value. The version which follows is a compound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of all the three sources mentioned above, and has been here
divided into three parts, although it is not so in the original,
for convenience of commentary.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be seen that in these first five sections or clauses of
the Confession, we have a confirmation in all essential points of
the version of the faith taught by Manes as it has been preserved
for us by the Mahommedan authors quoted above. It is even
possible that it was from this source that the author of the
<i>Fihrist</i> and Al-Bîrûnî derived some of their information concerning
the Manichaeans, and although it is impossible as yet
to fix any date for the Confession except within very wide
limits, it may be said that it is probably earlier than either of
the Mahommedan writers. It is certainly earlier than 1035
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, the date at which the grotto at Tun-huang in which one
of the copies was bricked up<a id='r1162'></a><a href='#f1162' class='c008'><sup>[1162]</sup></a>. But it seems plain that it must
have long before been used in the Manichaean worship from the
fact that copies differing little, if at all, from each other have
been found in two different scripts. As two of these are in the
Turkish language, it seems likely that they were translated for
proselytizing purposes into this from the earlier Syriac version
shortly after the conquest of the Tou-kiue or Turks by the
Ouigours, which some authors put as far back as the <abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr>
century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr><a id='r1163'></a><a href='#f1163' class='c008'><sup>[1163]</sup></a> The tenets of the Manichaeans must have been
well settled for this to be possible, and we have here, therefore,
an account at first hand of Manichaean teaching at a date much
earlier than the Mahommedan authors quoted above, and first
reduced to writing between the earliest promulgation of Manes’
own teaching and the Mahommedan conquest of Persia. It is,
therefore, contemporary, or nearly so, with the period of activity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>of the Zoroastrianism revived by the Sassanides, and it is
interesting to find how much nearer in appearance to the
cosmology and theology of the Avesta are those of the <i>Khuastuanift</i>
than is the Christianized form of Manichaeism introduced
into Europe and Africa and combated by <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine.
Khormuzta, the First Man, is certainly Ahura Mazda, Oromazes,
or Ormuzd, while the Fivefold God here spoken of as the
“youth” is clearly to be identified with his five sons or the
armour left below on his defeat<a id='r1164'></a><a href='#f1164' class='c008'><sup>[1164]</sup></a>. Hence it is probable that
the Manichaeans in Upper Asia did not wish to appear as the
worshippers of any other deities than those of the Persian
nation<a id='r1165'></a><a href='#f1165' class='c008'><sup>[1165]</sup></a>, although where Christianity was the religion of the
State, they were willing to call these deities by other names<a id='r1166'></a><a href='#f1166' class='c008'><sup>[1166]</sup></a>.
Yet the dualism which is the real characteristic of the faith of
Manes here as elsewhere admits of no compromise, and the sin
against which the Section <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> is directed is plainly that
Zervanist heresy which would make <i>Zervan akerene</i> or Boundless
Time the author of all things, and Ormuzd and Ahriman alike
his sons. The part played by the Sun and Moon in the redemption
of the Light is here the same as that assigned to them in
both the Christian and the Mahommedan accounts of Manes’
own teaching, but nothing is here said of the wheel which
appears in the former<a id='r1167'></a><a href='#f1167' class='c008'><sup>[1167]</sup></a>. The Divine “Burkhans” mentioned
in Section <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> are, as we shall see later, the Divine Messengers
sent from time to time into the present world to assist in the
redemption of the Light. The sinfulness of feeding upon,
injuring, or even angering the lower animals is here much more
strongly insisted upon than in the other documents and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>demands repentance even in the case of the Hearers, and this
points directly to a closer connection with Buddhism than
hitherto has been thought possible. It is plainly opposed to
the later Zoroastrian teaching, which makes the killing of
certain animals belonging to the creation of Ahriman a religious
duty; and may therefore have only been adopted by the
Manichaeans when they found themselves in contact with a
large community of professed Buddhists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next five sections of the <i>Khuastuanift</i> run thus:</p>

<p class='c009'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr>. “If, O my God, we have wandered into sin, and have
committed the ten kinds of sin in thoughts, words, and deeds. If
we have made up fraudulent lies; if we have sworn false oaths;
if we have borne false witness; if we have treated as guilty guiltless
men; if by fetching and carrying tales we have set men at variance,
and thereby have perverted their minds; if we have practised
magic; if we have killed many animated and moving beings; if we
have given way to wanton pleasures; if we have wasted the hard-earned
gains of industrious men; if we have sinned against the God
of the Sun and Moon<a id='r1168'></a><a href='#f1168' class='c008'><sup>[1168]</sup></a>. If in our past and present lives since we
have become Manichaeans [<i>i.e.</i> Hearers] we have sinned and gone
astray, thereby bringing confusion and discord upon so many
animated beings, O my God, to cleanse ourselves from sin, so pray
we now, <i>Manâstâr hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>
<p class='c013'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>VII</abbr>. “Who is he who wandering in sin comes to the entry
of the two poison-laden ways, and to the road which leads astray to
the Gate of Hell? The first is he who holds to false doctrines; the
second is he who invokes the Demon as God and falls down before
him. O my God, if wandering in sin, we have failed to recognize
and understand the true God and his pure faith, and have not believed
what the Burkhans and the pure Elect have preached<a id='r1169'></a><a href='#f1169' class='c008'><sup>[1169]</sup></a>, and have
instead believed on those who preach falsely, saying ‘I preach the
true God, and I expound the faith rightly.’ If we have accepted
the words of such a one and have unwittingly kept wrongful fasts,
and have unwittingly bowed ourselves wrongfully, and wrongfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>given alms; or if we have said ‘We will acquire merit’ and thereby
have unwittingly committed evil deeds; or if, invoking the Demon
and the Fiend as God, we have sacrificed to them animated and
moving beings; or if, saying, ‘this is the precept of the Burkhan,’
we have put ourselves under a false law and have bowed ourselves,
blessing it. If, thus sinning against God, we have prayed to the
Demon. O my God, to cleanse ourselves from sin, so pray we now:
<i>Manâstâr hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>
<p class='c013'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>VIII</abbr>. “When we came to the knowledge of the true God
and the pure Law, we knew the Two Principles and the Law of the
Three Ages<a id='r1170'></a><a href='#f1170' class='c008'><sup>[1170]</sup></a>. The Light Principle we knew to be the Paradise of
God and the Dark Principle to be the Land of Hell. We knew what
existed before Heaven and Earth, the Earth of God, was. We
knew how God and the Demon fought with one another, and how
Light and Darkness became mingled together, and how Heaven and
Earth were created. We knew how the Earth of the Rulers and its
Heaven will disappear, and how the Light will be freed from the
Darkness, and what will then happen to all things. We believed in
and put our faith in the God Azrua, in the God of the Sun and Moon,
in the Mighty God<a id='r1171'></a><a href='#f1171' class='c008'><sup>[1171]</sup></a>, and in the Burkhans, and thus we became
Hearers. Four bright seals have we carved upon our hearts. One is
Love which is the seal of the God Azrua<a id='r1172'></a><a href='#f1172' class='c008'><sup>[1172]</sup></a>; the second is Faith, which
is the seal of the God of the Sun and Moon; the third is the Fear
of God which is the seal of the Fivefold God; and the fourth is
the wise Wisdom, which is the seal of the Burkhans. If, O my God,
we have turned away our spirits and minds from these four (categories
of) Gods; if we have spurned them from their rightful place, and
the Divine Seals have thus been broken, O my God, to cleanse ourselves
from sin, so pray we now: <i>Manâstâr hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>
<p class='c013'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr>. “In the Ten Commandments, we have been ordered
to keep three with the mouth, three with the heart, three with the
hand, and one with the whole self. If, O my God, we have wittingly
or unwittingly by cleaving to the love of the body, or by listening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to the words of wicked companions and friends, of associates and
fellows; or by reason of our having much cattle and other possessions;
or by our foolish attachment to the things of this world, we
have broken these ten commandments, and have been found wanting
and of no avail: O my God, to cleanse ourselves from sin, so pray
we now: <i>Manâstâr hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>
<p class='c013'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>X</abbr>. “We have been ordered to render every day, with a
whole mind and a pure heart, four praises to the God Azrua, to the
God of the Sun and Moon, to the Mighty God, and to the Burkhans.
If from lack of the fear of God or from slackness our praises have
been offered unseemly, or if in offering them we have not turned our
hearts and minds towards God, so that our praises and prayers have
not reached God in pure wise, but have remained in another place:
O my God, to cleanse ourselves from sin, so pray we now: <i>Manâstâr
hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>

<p class='c010'>This second part of the Confession, perhaps, deals with
errors of conduct as the first does with errors of belief. The
ten sins given in the <abbr title='sixth'>VIth</abbr> Section do not agree exactly with
the list given in the <i>Fihrist</i> which says that the Manichaean
Hearers were enjoined to abstain from prayers offered to idols,
from lying, from greed, from murder, adultery, theft, from
false teaching, from magic, from doubt in religion, and from
slackness in action<a id='r1173'></a><a href='#f1173' class='c008'><sup>[1173]</sup></a>; but perhaps all these prohibitions could
be read into the list in the <i>Khuastuanift</i>. The <abbr title='seventh'>VIIth</abbr> Section
seems to be directed not so much against other religions as
against schisms within the Manichaean Church<a id='r1174'></a><a href='#f1174' class='c008'><sup>[1174]</sup></a>, and it is
evident that its authors knew of bloody sacrifices offered to
the Powers of Darkness as described by Plutarch apart from
the magic or sorcery condemned in the preceding section. In
the <abbr title='eighth'>VIIIth</abbr> Section, we have also for the second time a new name
for God in the word Azrua, which Prof. von Le Coq leaves
unexplained; but which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Gauthiot considers to be the same
as, or rather the equivalent in Soghdian of Zervan<a id='r1175'></a><a href='#f1175' class='c008'><sup>[1175]</sup></a>. Zervan,
however, can hardly be here the Supreme God worshipped by
Yezdegerd, especially as the <i>Khuastuanift</i> has just, as we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>seen, formally condemned as blasphemers those who say that
Ormuzd and Ahriman are brethren, and therefore by implication
those who give both Powers Zervan for a father. It seems
more likely that the name is either a corruption of Ahura Mazda
or perhaps of the Sanskrit Asura; but in any event, there can
be no doubt that it denotes the King of the Paradise of Light,
as the Highest Good God is called in the <i>Fihrist</i>. The division
of the Ten Commandments of Manes into three of the mouth,
three of the hand, three of the heart, and one of the whole
being recalls <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine’s description of the three seals,
the <span lang="la"><i>signaculum oris</i>, <i>signaculum manus</i></span>, and <span lang="la"><i>signaculum sinus</i></span>,
observed by the Manichaeans<a id='r1176'></a><a href='#f1176' class='c008'><sup>[1176]</sup></a>; while the description in Section
<abbr title='ten'>X</abbr> of the four praises (or hymns) to be rendered daily bears
out what is said above as to the praises of man being of
importance for the actual redemption of the Light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining sections of the <i>Khuastuanift</i> are:</p>

<p class='c009'><abbr title='section'>Sect.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>XI.</abbr> “We have been ordered to give reverently seven kinds
of alms for the sake of the pure Law. It has also been ordered that
when the angels of the Light of the Five Gods and the two Appellant
and Respondent Gods bring to us the Light of the Five Gods which

<p class='c010'>Here follows a lacuna of four lines, after which the Confession
resumes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O my God. We are full of defects and sins! We are thine
adversaries and grieve thee by thoughts, words and deeds, for the
sake of the greedy and shameless Demon of Envy. Gazing with our
eyes, hearing with our ears, seizing with our hands, and trampling
with our feet, we ever torture and impede the Light of the Five Gods,
the dry and wet earth, the five kinds of animals, and the five kinds
of plants and trees. So full are we of defects and sins! On account
of the Ten Commandments, the seven kinds of Alms, the three seals,
we are called Hearers; yet we cannot perform what these claim of
us. If, wandering in sin, we have sinned against the Gods of Light,
against the pure Law, against the Herald God<a id='r1179'></a><a href='#f1179' class='c008'><sup>[1179]</sup></a> and the Preacher, the
Men of God [the Preachers, according to Le Coq], against the
pure Elect. If we have not walked according to the letter and spirit
of the spoken words of God. If we have grieved the hearts of the
Gods. If we have been unable to keep the Days of Atonement, the
rigid fast, to offer the Praises and the Blessings according to the
Law and the Rite. If we have been found lacking and unprofitable,
and have day by day and month by month committed sins and
trespasses—to the Gods of Light, to the Majesty of the Law, to the
pure Elect, to cleanse ourselves from sin, so pray we now: <i>Manâstâr
hîrzâ!</i> (Our sin remit!)”</p>

<p class='c010'>These last five sections of the <i>Khuastuanift</i> give us a glimpse
of the religious observances of the Manichaeans which alters
somewhat the picture of them which we should have formed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>the account of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine and other Christian writers. The
seven kinds of alms referred to in Section <abbr title='eleven'>XI</abbr>, are not, as
might be thought, the gifts to necessitous or helpless persons
prescribed alike by the Christian and the Mahommedan
religions. It is apparent both from the context and from other
sources of information that they are the offerings of food made
by the lay or lowest members of the Manichaean community
to the Elect or Perfect, who are spoken of in the subsequent
sections as being already a species of Gods. This practice was
certainly known to <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine, and was not likely to sink
into oblivion in a community in contact with Buddhists,
among whom monks living upon food given in alms by the
faithful were a common sight. But the reason assigned by
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine for the practice, which was before obscure, here
receives full explanation. The particles of light diffused
through matter, and therefore inhabiting the bodies of animals
and plants, could only, in Manichaean opinion, be set free by
passing into the bodies of the semi-divine Elect. Thus says
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine in his treatise against the Manichaean Perfect,
Faustus<a id='r1180'></a><a href='#f1180' class='c008'><sup>[1180]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“This foolish notion of making your disciples bring you food, that
your teeth and stomach may be the means of relieving Christ who
is bound up in it, is a consequence of your profane fancies. You
declare that Christ is liberated in this way—not, however, entirely;
for you hold that some tiny particles of no value still remain in the
excrement, to be mixed up and compounded again in various
material forms, and to be released and purified at any rate by the
fire in which the world will be burned up, if not before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With the substitution of the “Light of the Fivefold God” for
Christ—the use of this last name being probably either the gloss
of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine himself, or else the concession made by the
Manichaean missionaries after their manner to the religious
prepossessions of those among whom they hoped to gain
converts—we have here the doctrine more plainly stated in
the <i>Khuastuanift</i>. The Hearers are to labour perpetually,
idleness being one of the Manichaean deadly sins, and to present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the fruits of their labour in the shape of food to the Perfect.
Not only will the particles of Light imprisoned in this last thus
be conveyed to the Land of the Gods; but it will be prevented
from going to the Land of Evil, which it would do if it were
consumed by the bodies of the Hearers or, <span lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span>, of those
profane persons who belonged to other faiths than the Manichaean.
Thus is explained the inhumanity of which many
writers accuse the Manichaean community, which led them to
refuse food to their neighbours in time of famine, alleging that
all that they produced must be reserved for those of the Faith<a id='r1181'></a><a href='#f1181' class='c008'><sup>[1181]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This explains also the merit assigned to the observance of
the many fasts enjoined in the concluding sections of the
<i>Khuastuanift</i>. The fifty <i>Vusanti</i> fasts together with the month’s
rigid fast to be kept by the Hearers would all have the effect of
diminishing their consumption of food in the shape of animals
and plants, which hinders the liberation of the particles of
Light imprisoned therein. In the choice of the days set apart
for these fasts we see another instance of the Manichaean
practice as assimilating the outward observances of other
religions. The fifty <i>Vusanti</i> fasts would give an average of very
nearly one a week, and were probably kept on Sunday, the
distinction between the Elect and the Hearers in this respect
noted by the Mahommedan writer being probably due to some
misconception. The month’s rigid fast possibly accorded with
the Arab Ramadan and must have been very useful in preventing
the Hearers from appearing singular when among Mahommedans;
and the seven <i>Yimki</i> or Days of Atonement seem to
have been copied from the observances of the Jews. So
possibly was the ritual practice alluded to in the <abbr title='fourteenth'>XIVth</abbr> section
of meeting together at certain times to confess their sins, and as
this is here said to take place in the House of Prayer, it entirely
disposes of the theory set up by earlier writers that the Manichaeans
had no temples, synagogues, or churches of their own<a id='r1182'></a><a href='#f1182' class='c008'><sup>[1182]</sup></a>.
The confession and prayer enjoined in Section <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr> were
doubtless to be repeated privately and in whatever place the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Hearer found himself at the fortnightly periods there specified,
and this Litany was very probably the <i>Khuastuanift</i> itself<a id='r1183'></a><a href='#f1183' class='c008'><sup>[1183]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>What other ritual was performed in these Manichaean
meeting-places is still doubtful. The Christian writers declare
that the Manichaeans celebrated a sacrament resembling the
Eucharist with the horrible accompaniments before alluded to
in the case of the followers of Simon Magus<a id='r1184'></a><a href='#f1184' class='c008'><sup>[1184]</sup></a>. The same
accusation was made, as has been many times said above, by
nearly all the sects of the period against each other, and we
have no means of determining its truth. It is however fairly
certain from the silence observed on the subject by the
<i>Khuastuanift</i> that no sacramental feast of any kind was either
celebrated by or in the presence of the Hearers or general body
of Manichaeans. If the Perfect or Elect partook of any such
meal among themselves, it possibly consisted of bread and water
only and was probably a survival of some custom traditional in
Western Asia of which we have already seen the traces in the
Mysteries of Mithras<a id='r1185'></a><a href='#f1185' class='c008'><sup>[1185]</sup></a>. The pronounced Docetism which led
the Manichaeans to regard the body of the historical Jesus as a
phantom shows that they could not have attributed to this meal
any sacramental efficacy like that involved in the doctrines either
of the Real Presence or of the Atonement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case is different with regard to pictures. The Manichaeans
forbade the use of statues or probably of any representations
of the higher spiritual powers, no doubt in recollection
of the idea current among the Persians even in Herodotus’ time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>that the gods had not the nature of men. Yet the Jewish and
later the Mahommedan prohibition against making likenesses of
anything had evidently no weight with them, and even before
the recent discoveries there was a tradition that Manes himself
was in the habit of using symbolical pictures called Ertenki-Mani
as a means of propaganda<a id='r1186'></a><a href='#f1186' class='c008'><sup>[1186]</sup></a>. The truth of this is now
amply confirmed by the German discoveries at Turfan, where
Prof. von Le Coq found frescoes representing possibly Manes
himself, together with paintings on silk showing the souls of
the faithful dead in the Moon-ship<a id='r1187'></a><a href='#f1187' class='c008'><sup>[1187]</sup></a>. Sir Marc Stein seems to
have secured similar relics at Tun-huang, and when these are
more thoroughly examined it is possible that they may throw
light upon many points of Manichaean symbolism yet obscure
to us. The fact that the Manichaean meeting-houses were
decorated with symbolical pictures seems thereby already
established.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of their fasts, the principal ones have been already indicated
in the <i>Khuastuanift</i>, and their feasts seem to have been few,
almost the only one of which any mention has come down to
us being that which was called the Festival of the Bema or
pulpit, when an empty chair on five steps was placed in a
conspicuous position in the meeting-house and adored by all
present. This was said to have been done in commemoration
of Manes as their founder and on the date preserved as the
anniversary of his death<a id='r1188'></a><a href='#f1188' class='c008'><sup>[1188]</sup></a>. If it be really true that any Manichaeans
whether Hearers or otherwise kept Sunday as a holiday,
it must have been, as Neander suggests, not because it was
the day of the Resurrection, in which their Docetic doctrines
prevented them from believing, but as the day of the Sun.
In like manner they probably observed Christmas as the
birthday not of Jesus, but of the Sun-god in accordance
with the traditions preserved by the worshippers of Mithras<a id='r1189'></a><a href='#f1189' class='c008'><sup>[1189]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span><abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine speaks, too, of their keeping Easter<a id='r1190'></a><a href='#f1190' class='c008'><sup>[1190]</sup></a>. It seems
possible that this was only done in Christian countries, in
accordance with their usual custom of conforming in outward
matters, and we have no evidence of their doing anything of
the sort in Turkestan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the sacred books of the Manichaeans we hear much,
although only one has survived to us in anything like completeness.
Thus we hear from Al-Bîrûnî that the Manichaeans
have a gospel of their own “the contents of which from the
first to the last are opposed to the doctrine of the Christians,”
and this he says was called “the Gospel of the Seventy<a id='r1191'></a><a href='#f1191' class='c008'><sup>[1191]</sup></a>.” He
also tells us of a book written by Manes himself called <i>Shaburkan</i>
or Shapurakhan which was doubtless written for the edification
of King Shâpûr or Sapor, the son of Ardeshîr, whose name it
bears<a id='r1192'></a><a href='#f1192' class='c008'><sup>[1192]</sup></a>. In this Manes seems to have described his own birth
and his assumption of the office of heavenly messenger or
“Burkhan,” besides the saying as to the Burkhans before him,
Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus, as described above<a id='r1193'></a><a href='#f1193' class='c008'><sup>[1193]</sup></a>. We also
hear from Al-Bîrûnî that he wrote a gospel arranged according
to the 22 letters of the alphabet, which does not seem to be
the same as the Gospel of the Seventy<a id='r1194'></a><a href='#f1194' class='c008'><sup>[1194]</sup></a>, and we hear from other
sources of a Book of the Giants, a Book of Secrets, a Book of
Precepts, a Book of Lifegiving, and others, together with many
letters or epistles all supposed to be by Manes’ own hand<a id='r1195'></a><a href='#f1195' class='c008'><sup>[1195]</sup></a>. As
has been said, he and his followers rejected the Old Testament
entirely, not indeed denying its inspiration, but declaring this
to have come from the Evil Principle. Of the New Testament,
Faustus, the Manichaean Perfect who disputed with <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine,
puts the matter very clearly when he says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We receive only so much of the New Testament as says anything
to the honour of the Son of Glory, either by Himself or by His
apostles; and by the latter only after they had become perfect and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>believers. As for the rest, anything that was said by them either in
their simplicity and ignorance, while they were yet inexperienced in
the truth, or with malicious design was inserted by the enemy
among the statements of truth, or was incautiously asserted by other
writers and thus handed down to later generations—of all this we
desire to know nothing. I mean all such statements as these—that
He was shamefully born of a woman; that as a Jew He was circumcised;
that He offered sacrifices like a heathen; that He was meanly
baptized, led into the wilderness, and miserably tempted<a id='r1196'></a><a href='#f1196' class='c008'><sup>[1196]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus it seems that the Manichaeans accepted only such facts
of the Gospel narrative as did not conflict with their own
doctrines, and although they are said to have had an especial
veneration for <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Paul, there is no reason to think that this
extended to the writings of the Apostle to the Gentiles, or had
any other motive than that of external conformity with the
religion of those whom they were endeavouring to convert. As
himself the Paraclete announced in the New Testament, Manes
claimed for himself an authority superior to that of all apostles,
and if he made use of any of the writings attributed to them,
it was probably only in the shape of isolated passages divorced
from their context. On the other hand, his followers seem to
have made free use of apocryphal or pseudepigraphical books
written in the names of the apostles and containing statements
which could be explained as confirming Manes’ teaching. A
great number of these had as their common authors the names
of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Thomas and <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Andrew, and the Fathers declare that
they were for the most part the work of one Leucius, whom
they assert was a Manichaean<a id='r1197'></a><a href='#f1197' class='c008'><sup>[1197]</sup></a>. It may be so; but, as all the
copies of these works which have come down to us have been
expurgated or, in the language of the time, “made orthodox,”
by the removal of heretical matter, there is little proof of the
fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>More authentic, however, than these pseudepigrapha and
much fuller than the extracts preserved by Christian or Mahommedan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>writers is a treatise found in the cave of the Thousand
Buddhas at Tun-huang which has been published only last
year. It seems by an extraordinary chance to have nearly
escaped us, having been apparently missed by all the European
expeditions because it was written in Chinese characters.
Hence it was removed to Pekin by orders of the Chinese
Government under the impression that it was Buddhist in its
nature, and has since been published in a Chinese publication
founded for the purpose of preserving the Tun-huang <abbr title='manuscripts'>MSS.</abbr> by
Mr Lo Tchen-yu, a Chinese scholar of great philosophical and
archaeological attainments<a id='r1198'></a><a href='#f1198' class='c008'><sup>[1198]</sup></a>. It is written on a continuous roll
of paper over six metres in length, which has led unfortunately
to the disappearance of the title and the first few words of the
treatise. The remainder shows, however, that it purports to
be a sort of allocution addressed by Manes, here as in the
<i>Khuastuanift</i> called the “Legate of the Light,” to Adda or
Addas, whom we know from the Christian documents before
quoted to have been one of the three great missionaries said to
have been dispatched by Manes into foreign countries to
propagate his doctrine<a id='r1199'></a><a href='#f1199' class='c008'><sup>[1199]</sup></a>. Of these three, Thomas, Hermas, and
Addas, the last-named is said to have been allotted “Scythia,”
which here as elsewhere doubtless means Turkestan, and his
name therefore gives a reasonable air of authenticity to the
text. The whole document is written in the form of a Buddhist
<i>sutra</i>, and has been translated with an excellent commentary
by the French Sinologist, <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Edouard Chavannes, with the help
of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Paul Pelliot, the leader of the French Expedition to
Turkestan which probably first discovered it<a id='r1200'></a><a href='#f1200' class='c008'><sup>[1200]</sup></a>. It entirely
confirms the Mahommedan account of the teaching of Manes
given above as well as that appearing in the <i>Khuastuanift</i>, and
shows that <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine, alike in his authentic writings and in
the tract <span lang="la"><i>de Haeresibus</i></span> generally, although perhaps wrongfully,
attributed to him, was drawing from well-informed sources.
There are many grounds for thinking that it may originally
have been written in Pahlavi, in which case it may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>contemporary with Manes himself; but it frequently makes use
of Buddhist phrases often derived from the Sanskrit<a id='r1201'></a><a href='#f1201' class='c008'><sup>[1201]</sup></a>. If the
view here taken of the date of the original treatise is well
founded, these may have been introduced by Manes during the
time that the tradition mentioned above says that he spent in
Turkestan for the elaboration of his doctrine. At all events
they show that the practice of adapting his religion, as far as
might be, to accord with that previously held by those among
whom he was trying to make proselytes, goes back to the very
origin of the sect.</p>

<p class='c007'>This treatise was evidently written for edification rather than
for instruction, and gives us a curious idea of the imagery by
which the Manichaean teachers sought to enforce their teaching.
The theory of the macrocosm and the microcosm, which teaches
that the body of man is in itself a copy of the great world or
universe, is here carried to excess<a id='r1202'></a><a href='#f1202' class='c008'><sup>[1202]</sup></a>, and we hear much of the
“trees” which certain demons, previously sticking to the
elements, says the treatise, “like a fly to honey, a bird to bird-lime,
or a fish to the hook<a id='r1203'></a><a href='#f1203' class='c008'><sup>[1203]</sup></a>,” plant in the soul to the corruption
and ultimate death of the better desires there implanted by
the Light. The combat waged against the diabolic vices by
the virtues is also described with great minuteness, but in
language in which it is sometimes difficult to discover whether
the author is consciously using allegory or not. Thus he says
that the Devil, to whom he attributes the formation of the
body of man, “shut up the Pure Ether” (one of the five light
elements)</p>

<p class='c009'>“in the city of the bones. He established (there) the dark thought
in which he planted a tree of death. Then he shut up the Excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Wind in the city of the nerves. He established (there) the dark
feeling in which he planted a tree of death. Then he shut up the
strength of the Light in the city of the veins. He established (there)
the dark reflection in which he planted a tree of death. Then he
shut up the Excellent Water in the city of the flesh. He established
there the dark intellect, in which he planted a tree of death. Then
he shut up the Excellent Fire in the city of the skin. He established
there the dark reasoning in which he planted a tree of death. The
Demon of Envy [the name generally used in the treatise for the
Devil] planted these five poisonous trees of death in the five kinds of
ruined places. He made them on every occasion deceive and trouble
the original luminous nature, to draw in from without the nature
which is stranger to it, and to produce poisonous fruit. Thus the
tree of the dark thought grows within the city of the bones; its
fruit is hatred: the tree of the dark feeling grows within the city
of the nerves; its fruit is irritation: the tree of the dark reflection
grows within the city of the veins; its fruit is luxury [wantonness]:
the tree of the dark intellect grows within the city of the flesh; its
fruit is anger: the tree of the dark reasoning grows within the city
of the skin; its fruit is folly. It is thus then that of the five kinds
of things which are the bones, the nerves, the veins, the flesh, and
the skin, he made a prison and shut up there the five divisions of the
First Principle of Light....<a id='r1204'></a><a href='#f1204' class='c008'><sup>[1204]</sup></a>”</p>

<p class='c010'>and so on. One might sometimes think one was reading John
Bunyan and his Holy War with its defence of the town of
Mansoul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the information contained in this Pekin Treatise has
been dealt with in its place, but there are one or two matters
concerning the cosmology of Manes which are of importance as
showing the connection of his system with that of his predecessors.
One regards the two great angels, here called Khrostag
and Padvaktag<a id='r1205'></a><a href='#f1205' class='c008'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> or the Appellant and Respondent, who are
mentioned in the <i>Khuastuanift</i> (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_343'>343</a> <i>supra</i>) as bringing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>light to be purified<a id='r1206'></a><a href='#f1206' class='c008'><sup>[1206]</sup></a>. As has been said above, they show a great
likeness to the two last Amshaspands of Zoroastrianism called
Haurvetât and Ameretât; and like them are never mentioned
separately, but always together<a id='r1207'></a><a href='#f1207' class='c008'><sup>[1207]</sup></a>. Another point, already
referred to, is that the Zoroastrian Sraôsha, the strong archangel
who guards the world at night from the demons, is here mentioned
several times by name<a id='r1208'></a><a href='#f1208' class='c008'><sup>[1208]</sup></a>. Yet another point is that the
two sexes are here said to have been formed by the devil out of
jealousy and rage at beholding the sun and moon, and in
imitation of the two luminaries. This is an entirely different
story not only from those given above as Manichaean but from
that given in the <i>Great Announcement</i> attributed to Simon
Magus, and both differ from that told in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>.
It seems plain therefore that in attributing these various origins
to the division of mankind into sexes, none of the three teachers
was drawing upon tradition, but was merely inventing <i>ad hoc</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There remains to be considered the history of the sect, as
to which we have become better informed during the last few
decades than at one time seemed possible<a id='r1209'></a><a href='#f1209' class='c008'><sup>[1209]</sup></a>. Prohibited in the
Roman Empire from the outset, they nevertheless made their
way along both shores of the Mediterranean, and all the efforts
of the Imperial authorities proved powerless to suppress them.
Constantine directed an enquiry into their tenets, it is said,
with some idea of making them into the religion of the State,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>and although he found this impracticable or unsafe, he seems
to have been at first inclined to extend to them toleration<a id='r1210'></a><a href='#f1210' class='c008'><sup>[1210]</sup></a>.
His successors, however, quickly reverted to the earlier policy
of Diocletian, and law after law of gradually increasing severity
was passed until adherence to Manichaeism was finally punished
with death and confiscation<a id='r1211'></a><a href='#f1211' class='c008'><sup>[1211]</sup></a>. Pagans like the Emperor Julian
and his friend and teacher Libanius were able occasionally to
intervene in their favour; but no sect was ever more relentlessly
persecuted, and the institution of the Dominican Inquisition
can be traced back to the <i>Quaestiones</i> set up by Justinian and
Theodora for their routing out and suppression<a id='r1212'></a><a href='#f1212' class='c008'><sup>[1212]</sup></a>. In the case
of what was practically a secret society, it would be difficult
to say whether the Imperial measures would have availed to
entirely destroy their propaganda, and it is possible that the
Manichaean Church always maintained a sporadic existence in
Europe<a id='r1213'></a><a href='#f1213' class='c008'><sup>[1213]</sup></a> until events to be presently mentioned led to its revival
in the <abbr title='tenth'><span class='fss'>X</span>th</abbr> century. Meanwhile in the East, they remained on
the confines of what was, up to the Mahommedan conquest in
642 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, the Persian Empire, and no doubt after their manner
professed outward adherence to the Zoroastrian faith, while at
the same time propagating their own doctrines in secret<a id='r1214'></a><a href='#f1214' class='c008'><sup>[1214]</sup></a>. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>was probably the Arab conquest which drove them to make
their headquarters on the very borders of the civilized world
as known to the ancients and in what is now Turkestan. Here
a large part of the population seems to have been Buddhist,
doubtless by reason of its dealings with China, and in the
presence of that gentle faith—whose adherents boast that they
have never yet shed blood to make a convert—the Manichaeans
enjoyed complete toleration for perhaps the first time in their
history<a id='r1215'></a><a href='#f1215' class='c008'><sup>[1215]</sup></a>. They made use of it, as always, to send out missionaries
into the neighbouring countries, and certainly obtained
a foothold in China, where the Chinese seem to have confused
them with the Christians. Their hatred of images doubtless
caused the iconoclastic Emperors of the East to enter into
relation with them, and we hear that Leo the Isaurian induced
many of them to enter the Imperial armies. It was possibly
these last whom the Emperor John Tzimiskes settled in what
is now Bulgaria, whence, under the names of Paulicians,
Bogomiles, and other aliases, they promoted that movement
against the Catholic Church which provoked the Albigensian
Crusades and the establishment of the Dominican Inquisition
in the West<a id='r1216'></a><a href='#f1216' class='c008'><sup>[1216]</sup></a>. To follow them there would be to travel beyond
the scope of this book; and it need only be said in conclusion
that they formed the bitterest and the most dangerous enemies
that the Catholic Church in Europe ever had to face. It was
possibly this which has led the rulers of the Church of Rome to
brand nearly all later heresy with the name of Manichaean; yet
it may be doubted whether some of their doctrines did not
survive in Europe until the German Reformation, when they
may have helped to inspire some of the wilder Protestant sects
of the <abbr title='sixteenth'><span class='fss'>XVI</span>th</abbr> and <abbr title='seventeenth'><span class='fss'>XVII</span>th</abbr> centuries. With the suppression of the
Albigenses, however, the existence of Manichaeism as an
organized faith comes to an end.</p>

  <h2 id='chap-conclusion' class='c005'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Constantine’s accession proved to be, like the coming of
Alexander, a turning-point in the history of the world. His
so-called conversion put into the hands of the Catholic Church
a weapon for the suppression of all rivalry, of which she was
not slow to make use. Already in his reign many of the
heathen temples were torn down<a id='r1217'></a><a href='#f1217' class='c008'><sup>[1217]</sup></a>, and under the rule of his
morose and gloomy successor, Constantius, the work of demolition
went on apace<a id='r1218'></a><a href='#f1218' class='c008'><sup>[1218]</sup></a>. The accession of the philosophic Julian
gave the worshippers of other gods than Christ a short respite,
and even allowed some of the temples destroyed in the former
reigns to be restored by or at the expense of the Christians<a id='r1219'></a><a href='#f1219' class='c008'><sup>[1219]</sup></a>.
Julian’s heroic death in Persia again threw the crown into the
hands of a Christian emperor, whose reign of seven months
gave him little time, as he perhaps had small inclination, for
persecution<a id='r1220'></a><a href='#f1220' class='c008'><sup>[1220]</sup></a>; but under his successors Valentinian and Valens,
heathen sacrifices were forbidden under severe penalties. The
end came under Gratian, when the temple estates were confiscated,
the priests and vestals deprived of the stipends which
they had hitherto received from the public treasury, and the
heathen confraternities or colleges were declared incapable of
receiving legacies<a id='r1221'></a><a href='#f1221' class='c008'><sup>[1221]</sup></a>. Only a few rich men like the Vettius
Agorius Praetextatus whom we have seen among the worshippers
of Mithras, or the Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, whose learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and patriotic life has been so well described by Sir Samuel
Dill<a id='r1222'></a><a href='#f1222' class='c008'><sup>[1222]</sup></a>, could henceforth venture to practise, even with maimed
rites, the faiths condemned by the Court and the Church.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for the Gnostic sects, which since Hadrian’s time had
striven with such success as we have seen to combine magic
and other ancient beliefs with Christianity, they found but
short shrift at the hands of the triumphant Church. By an
edict issued by Constantine before his own reception into the
Church, all their “houses of prayer” were confiscated for the
benefit of the Catholic Church, their meeting even in private
forbidden, and their books seized and burned<a id='r1223'></a><a href='#f1223' class='c008'><sup>[1223]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thus,” says Eusebius, “were the lurking places of the
heretics broken up by the emperor’s command, and the savage
beasts they have harboured (I mean the chief authors of their
impious doctrines) driven to flight. Of those whom they had
deceived, some, intimidated by the emperor’s threats, disguising
their real feelings, crept secretly into the Church. For since the
law directed that search should be made for their books, those of
them who practised evil and forbidden arts were detected, and these
were ready to secure their own safety by dissimulation of every
kind<a id='r1224'></a><a href='#f1224' class='c008'><sup>[1224]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the length and breadth of the Roman Empire
all but a very few Roman nobles thus professed the faith of
Christ. In the words of the dying Julian, the Galilaean had
conquered.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time until our own, Christianity has reigned in
the West with no serious rival. In the <abbr title='seventh'><span class='fss'>VII</span>th</abbr> century, when
Mahommed’s Arabs, flushed with the enthusiasm of a new
faith which owed something at least to the relics of Gnosticism,
poured in upon an Empire wearied out alike by perpetual war
against the barbarians and by its own civil and religious
dissensions, the Church was compelled to abandon to them her
conquests in Africa and the East. In Europe, however, she
continued in unchecked supremacy, gathering to herself and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>assimilating the barbarians who at one time seemed likely to
extinguish all civilization; and she thus became a bond uniting
many nations and languages in one community of faith and
thought. She even succeeded in keeping alive the remains of
that Greek art and learning which still form our best and
proudest intellectual possession, and if during her reign many
of the precious monuments of antiquity perished, the fault was
not entirely hers. In every respect, her rule was supreme;
and such enemies as she had in Europe were those of her own
household. The Manichaeans who, as has been said, once bid
fair to deprive her of some of her fairest provinces, never
dared to make open war upon her, and their secret defection
was punished by an unsparing use of the secular arm. The
German Reformation of the <abbr title='sixteenth'><span class='fss'>XVI</span>th</abbr> century has probably left
her stronger than before, and the few losses that she has suffered
in the Old World have been more than compensated by the
number of lieges she has succeeded in attaching to herself in
the New.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the days of her infancy, and before she thus came into
her inheritance, Christianity borrowed much from the rivals
over which she was in the long run to reign supreme. Her
outward observances, her ritual, and the organization of her
hierarchy, are perhaps all due to the associations that she
finally overcame. The form of her sacraments, the periods of
her fasts and festivals, and institutions like monachism, cannot
be explained without reference to those religions from whose
rivalry she so long suffered. That, in such matters, the Church
should take what was useful to her was, as said above, part
of her consciously expressed policy, and doubtless had much
to do with her speedy triumph. To show that her dogmas
also took many things from the same source would involve
an invasion into the domain of professional theology, for which
I have neither authority nor desire. But if, at some future
time, investigation should show that in this respect also
Christianity owes something to her forerunners and rivals,
the argument against her Divine origin would not thereby be
necessarily strengthened. That, in the course of her development,
she acquired characteristics which fitted her to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>environment would be in strict conformity with the laws which
appear to govern the evolution of all institutions; and if the
Power ruling the universe chooses to work by law rather than
by what seems to us like caprice, such a choice does not show
Him to be lacking either in wisdom or benevolence.</p>

<p class='c007'>As was said at the outset, everyone must be left to place
his own interpretation on the facts here attempted to be set
forth. But if, <i>per impossibile</i>, we could approach the study of
the origins of Christianity with the same mental detachment
and freedom from prejudice with which we might examine
the worship of the Syrian Jupiter Dolichenus or the Scandinavian
Odin, we should probably find that the Primitive Church
had no need of the miraculous powers which were once assigned
as the reason for her gradual and steady advance to all but
universal dominion. On the contrary, it may be that Christianity
would then appear as a link—although a most important and
necessary link—in a regular chain of events which began
more than three centuries before she emerged from her birthplace
in Palestine into that Roman world which in three
centuries more was to be hers of right. No sooner had
Alexander’s conquests made a world-religion possible, than
there sprang up, as we have seen, in his own city of Alexandria,
a faith with a far higher and purer idea of Divinity than any
that had until then been known in the West. Then the germs
already present in small fraternities like those of the Orphics
and the Essenes blossomed forth into the fantastic and unwholesome
growths, as we must needs think them, of that
Gnosticism which marked the transition of the ancient world
from Paganism to Christianity. Lastly there came in from
the countries under the influence of Rome’s secular enemy,
Persia, the heresy of Marcion, the religion of Mithras, and the
syncretistic policy of Manes and his continuators. Against all
these in turn, Christianity had to struggle in a contest where
the victory was not always on her side: and if in time she
overthrew them all, it can only be because she was better
fitted to the needs of the world than any of her predecessors
or contemporaries.</p>

thinks is from Tacitus, showing that Titus aimed at the suppression of the
Christians as well as the Jews. Doubtless many Christians perished in the
punitive measures taken in the <abbr title='first'><span class='fss'>I</span>st</abbr> century against the Jews in Antioch

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>So that the members of the little Church of Pella who retained the
name of Jews gradually ceased to be regarded as orthodox by the other
Christian communities and were called Ebionites. See Renan, <span lang="fr"><i>L’Antéchrist</i></span>,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 548. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Fuller in <i>Dict. Christian Biog.</i> <abbr class='spell'><i>s.v.</i></abbr> Ebionites for authorities.

of Simon Magus. The <i>Clementine Homilies</i> (<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 24), from whom both
authors may have derived their information, have a long story about
Dositheus being with Simon a follower of John the Baptist, and disputing
with Simon the headship of the sect. From presumably other sources,
Hegesippus speaks of the Essenes, the Masbothoeans and the Hemero-baptists,
for which last see <a href='#chap13'>Chapter <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr></a>, <i>infra</i>, as pre-Christian sects.</p>

desire to become a διδάσκαλος or teacher that drove Tatian, once a
hearer of Justin Martyr’s, into heresy. Hegesippus, <i>ubi cit.</i> <i>supra</i>, says
that Thebuthis first corrupted the Church, on account of his not being
made a bishop. For the same accusation in the cases of Valentinus and
Marcion, see Chapters <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr> and <abbr title='eleven'>XI</abbr>, <i>infra</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Celsus <i>apud</i> Origen (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='three'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>cc.</abbr> 10, 11) says: “Christians at
first were few in number, and all held like opinions, but when they increased
to a great multitude, they were divided and separated, each wishing to
have his own individual party; for this was their object from the beginning”—a
contention which Origen rebuts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Thus in Egypt it was almost exclusively the lower classes which
embraced Christianity at the outset. See Amélineau, <span lang="fr">“Les Actes Coptes
du martyre de <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Polycarpe”</span> in <abbr class='spell'><i>P.S.B.A.</i></abbr> <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'><span class='fss'>X.</span></abbr> (1888), <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 392. Julian
(<i>Cyr.</i> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 206) says that under Tiberius and Claudius there were no

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Thus Cerinthus, who is made by tradition the opponent of <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John,
is said to have been a Jew and to have been trained in the doctrines of
Philo at Alexandria (Theodoret, <i>Haer. Fab.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> § 3). <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Neander,
<i>Ch. Hist.</i> (<abbr title='English edition'>Eng. ed.</abbr>) <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 42-47. Neander says the same thing about
Basilides (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 47 and note) and Valentinus (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 71), although it is
difficult to discover any authority for the statement other than the Jewish
features in their doctrines. There is more evidence for the statement
regarding Marcus, the heresiarch and magician whom Irenaeus (<i>op. cit.</i>
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 7) accuses of the seduction of Christian women, apparently in his
own time, since the words of Marcus’ ritual, which the Bishop of Lyons
quotes, are in much corrupted Hebrew, and the Jewish Cabala was used by
him. Renan’s view (<span lang="fr"><i>Marc Aurèle</i></span>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 139 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>) that Christianity in Egypt
never passed through the Judaeo-Christian stage may in part account for
the desire of Jewish converts there to set up schools of their own.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Clement was so far from being a heresiologist that he has not escaped
the reproach of being himself a heretic. He repeatedly speaks in praise of
the “true Gnostic,” meaning thereby the perfect Christian, and although
this is probably a mere matter of words, it seems to have induced Photius
in the <abbr title='ninth'><span class='fss'>IX</span>th</abbr> century to examine his writings with a jealous eye. The result
was that, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Courdaveaux points out (<abbr class='spell'><i>R.H.R.</i></abbr> 1892, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 293 and note),
he found him guilty of teaching that matter was eternal, the Son a simple
creature of the Father, the Incarnation only an appearance, that man’s soul
entered several bodies in succession, and that several worlds were created
before that of Adam. All these are Gnostic opinions, and it may be that if
we had all Clement’s books in our hands, as had Photius, we might confirm
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Courdaveaux’s judgment, as does apparently <abbr title='monseigneur'>Mgr</abbr> Duchesne. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> his

<p class='c007'>The ineffability of divine names was an old idea in Egypt, especially
in the Osirian religion, where it forms the base of the story of Ra and
Isis. So the name of Osiris himself was said to be ineffable. See Eug.
Lefébure in <i>Sphinx</i>, Stockholm, <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 99-102. The name of Marduk
of Babylon is in the same way declared ineffable in an inscription of Neriglissar,
<i>Trans. Roy. Soc. Litt.</i> 2nd series, <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 276. The name of
Yahweh became ineffable directly after Alexander. See Halévy, <span lang="fr"><i>Revue des
Études juives</i></span>, <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> (1884), <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 172. In every case, the magical idea that the
god might be compelled by utterance of his secret name seems to be at the
root of the practice. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Erman, <i>Life in Ancient Egypt</i>, <abbr title='English edition'>Eng. ed.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 354.</p>

expunged from the earlier version of the story, and it is possible that the
later interpolation is due to the desire of the translator to make the
teaching of the heretics as repulsive as possible. Theodoret merely copies
the Latin text of Irenaeus.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r157'>157</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This Divine Family or Council must have been an old idea in post-exilic
Judaism. Justin Martyr, <i>Dial. <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> Tryph.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 126, says that Christ
is called the “Angel of the Great Council” by Ezekiel, but the expression
is not to be found in the <abbr class='spell'>A.V.</abbr> Origen, <i>cont. Cels.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='five'><span class='fss'>V.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 53, also speaks
of a prophecy in which Jesus was described as the “Angel of the Great
Council, because he announced to men the great counsel of God”—a pun
which curiously enough is the same in Greek as in English. The Jews of
Elephantine worshipped in their temple a god and a goddess who were looked
upon as the assessors, if the inferiors, of Yahweh (see <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 4, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>, <i>supra</i>).
In the Talmud, it is said that God has an upper or celestial <i>familia</i> or
tribunal without consulting which he does nothing, and which is indicated
by the “holy ones” of <abbr title='Daniel'>Dan.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 17. See Taylor, <i>Pirke-Aboth</i>, Cambridge,

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r159'>159</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Giraud, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 95, thinks that in the Naassene teaching matter
does not really exist, all things being contained in Adamas. The absolute
antagonism of God and matter is, however, too strongly marked a feature
of nearly all the sources from which the Ophites can have drawn their
doctrine for his theory to be entertained. Berger, <span lang="fr"><i>Études des Documents
nouveaux fournis sur les Ophites par les Philosophumena</i></span>, Nancy, 1873,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 25, puts forward the same idea as a mere figure of speech and in order
apparently to reconcile the Ophite doctrine with <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s statement that
without the Word “nothing” was made. Later he (<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 61, 104, 105)
points out that the tendency of the Ophite like all other Gnostic doctrine
is to widen rather than to narrow the abyss between Spirit and Matter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f160'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r160'>160</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This is a variant, and an important one, of the Babylonian myth
which makes Bel, after defeating Tiamat the Dragon of Chaos, cut her in
two halves and make out of them the visible heaven and earth. See Rogers,
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 126. The heaven which there is fashioned from the powers of
evil, is here at any rate half divine. In later systems, such as one of those
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and especially that of the Manichaeans, the older
Babylonian idea is returned to. It would therefore seem that for the
modification here introduced, the Ophites were indebted to Jewish influence
and forced it to agree with the story of Genesis. See Irenaeus, <i>op. cit.</i>
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 28, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 229, Harvey.</p>

allusion to the figure of the Sophia which is so prominent in most of the
Gnostic systems and reappears in Manichaeism. There can, I think, be
no doubt that she is in effect the Great Goddess worshipped throughout
Western Asia, who appears under different names in Lydia, Phrygia,
Syria, Ionia, Crete, and Greece, and who is to be identified on etymological
grounds, if Prof. Garstang (<abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>, <i>supra</i>) is correct, with the Babylonian
Ishtar. That the Alexandrians saw her in their goddess Isis has already
been shown in <abbr title='chapter two'>Chap. II</abbr>. Her most prominent characteristics show her to
be a personification of the Earth, the mother of all living, ever bringing
forth and ever a virgin, as is shown in the “Goddesses Twain,” Demeter
and Cora. The dove was throughout Asia her symbol and perhaps
her totem animal (Strong, <i>The Syrian Goddess</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 22-24 for authority),
as the serpent was that of her spouse or male counterpart (Justin
Martyr, <i>First Apol.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'><span class='fss'>XXVII.</span></abbr>; Clem. Alex. <i>Protrept.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>). In the
Orphic cosmogonies she appears under her name of Gaia or Ge as the “first
bride” (Abel’s <i>Orphica</i>, <abbr title='frame'>fr.</abbr> 91) spouse of Uranos, as well as under all her
subsequent personifications. She seems, too, to bear much analogy with
the Persian Amshaspand, Spenta Armaiti, who is also identified with the
earth, and is called Sophia or Wisdom (Tiele, <i>Religion of the Iranian Peoples</i>,
<abbr title='English edition'>Eng. ed.</abbr> Bombay, 1912, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 130, 131). Whether the Persians also drew
this conception from the Babylonian Ishtar is a question which some years
ago might have been answered in the affirmative. Now, however, it has
been complicated by the identification of this Spenta Armaiti with the
Aramati of the Vedas—for which see <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Carnoy’s article <i>Aramati-Armatay</i>
in <span lang="fr"><i>Le Muséon</i></span>, Louvain, <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'><span class='fss'>XIII.</span></abbr> (1912), <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 127-146—and the discovery of
Winckler that the Vedic gods were worshipped in Asia Minor before 1272 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>
Her appearance in the cosmology of the Gnostics under the name of
Sophia is, however, probably due to the necessity of effecting by hook or
by crook a harmony between Gentile and Jewish ideas, and is doubtless
due in the first instance to the passage in the Book of Proverbs <abbr title='eight'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr>,
<abbr title='nine'><span class='fss'>IX.</span></abbr>, where Wisdom חָכְמָה or Ἀχαμώθ (in both languages feminine) is described
as existing from the beginning and the daily delight of Yahweh,
rejoicing always before him and his instrument in making the universe
(Clem. <i>Hom.</i> <abbr title='sixteen'><span class='fss'>XVI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 12). It is said that Simon Magus called his mistress
Helena by the name of Sophia, but the story only occurs in Victorinus of
Pettau and is probably due to a confusion with the Sophia of later sects like
that of Valentinus. In all these, with the single exception of that of
Marcion, she plays a predominant part in the destiny of mankind.</p>

as a power “half flame and half darkness” (<abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr> Ezekiel <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 2) projected by
one of the “triple-powered” gods of our universe and sent down into Chaos
for the destruction of the heroine; in one of the later documents of the book
we see him as lord of a particular portion of Chaos, where he presides over
the punishment of a certain class of sinning souls. His name offers many
difficulties. Gieseler reads it ילדא בהות, “son of Chaos,” and this
Salmon, <i>Dict. Christian Biog.</i> <abbr class='spell'>s.h.v.</abbr>, considers the most probable derivation,
although Harvey’s reading of יה־אל־דאבהות “Lord (or Jah) God
of the Fathers,” is certainly more appropriate. In the great Magic Papyrus
of Paris, the name appears as ⲁⲗⲑⲁⲂⲱⲧ, which can hardly be anything
else that Aldabôt or Adabôt, since we have ⲁⲗⲑⲱⲛⲁⲓ for Adonai in the
next line (Griffith, <i>The Old Coptic magical texts of Paris</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 3; extract
from the <span lang="de"><i>Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache</i></span>, <abbr title='band'>Bd.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-eight'><span class='fss'>XXXVIII.</span></abbr>). In Papyrus
<abbr title='forty-six'><span class='fss'>XLVI.</span></abbr> of the British Museum (Kenyon, <i>Gk. Pap.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 69), we find βαλβναβαωθ,
probably a clerical error for Jaldabaoth, which is again followed as before
by the name Αδωναι. In the Leyden Papyrus which calls itself
the “8th Book of Moses,” we have a god invoked as Aldabeim, which is
there said to be an Egyptian name, and to be the φυσικὸν ὄνομα
“natural name” of the sun and the boat in which he rises when he dawns
upon the world (Leemans, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 87, 119, 127). It is not at all certain,
however, which of these is the right spelling, for the German editors of
Hippolytus read in one place Esaldaios for Ialdabaoth, and the Magic
Papyrus last quoted has a name Aldazaô which is said to be quoted from
a book of Moses called <i>Archangelicus</i> (Leemans, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 157). The name
Ialdazaô (“El Shaddai”?) is used as that of the “God of Gods” in the
great Magic Papyrus of Paris, with whose name that of the aeon Sophia
is mentioned (Wessely, <span lang="de"><i>Griech. Zauberpap.</i></span> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 50). The most probable
conclusion is that Jaldabaoth represents some name or epithet of God current
among the Semitic Babylonians which had fallen into disuse and had
been much corrupted by being turned into and out of demotic. So Revillout
(<span lang="fr"><i>Revue Égyptologique</i></span>) gives an instance where the invocation ἐπίσχες
ἐπί με “Come unto me!” by a like process became transmogrified into
“<i>episkhesepimme</i>” without being recognized by the scribe as Greek.</p>

a more detailed repetition of the story is found in one of the latest documents
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, where Jesus tells His disciples that the ἀρχοντες or
rulers of Adamas once rebelled and persisted in begetting “archons and
archangels and angels and serving spirits and decans”; that the 12 aeons,
who are evidently the Signs of the Zodiac, divided into two companies
of six, half of them under the rule of one Jabraôth repenting and being
translated into a higher sphere, while the others were “bound” in our
firmament under the rule of the five planets. Perhaps the origin of the
whole story is the battle of the Gods and the serpent-footed giants, which
appears on the Mithraic bas-reliefs, for which see <abbr class='spell'><i>P.S.B.A.</i></abbr> 1912, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 134,

word for word as in Irenaeus; but it is manifestly taken from some other
source than that of the Greek text, and is inconsistent with the rest of the
story. If the Lower Sophia or Prunicos (the Substitute) were born from the
mere boiling over of the light shed upon her mother, of what had she to
“repent”? In the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, indeed, the heroine wins her way back
to her former estate by repentance, but <i>her</i> fall has been occasioned by disobedience
and ambition. So, too, the story about Jesus changing His form
on His descent through the seven heavens is common to the story of Pistis
Sophia and the legend of Simon Magus, which two it therefore connects
(see Chapter <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr>, <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 191, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 4). It also appears in the <i>Ascension of

<i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>, 1900, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> xi and 62), but which is probably of much

His teaching His disciples <span lang="la">“quod liquidum est,”</span> that is, without parable,
is also told in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, but His post-Resurrection life is there
put at 12 years. Irenaeus’ Latin translator has, as has been said, evidently
here got hold of some later developments of Ophitism not known to his
author at the time that the Greek text was written. Yet some tradition
of a long interval between the Resurrection and the Ascension was evidently
current in the sub-Apostolic age. Irenaeus himself says on the authority
of “those who met with John the Disciple of the Lord in Asia” that Jesus’
ministry only lasted for one year from His Baptism, He being then 30
years old, and that He suffered on completing his 30th year; yet that He
taught until He was 40 or 50 years old. See Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 33, § 3,

proof that the Ophites ever gave Chaos or unformed Matter a place

for the supposed “Chaos” in the second line of the Psalm should be
substituted some words like “the projected Thought” of the Father.

The πέλεκυς or double-bladed axe was the symbol of Zeus Labrandos
of Caria, and is often met with on the coins of Asia Minor, while it seems to
have played a prominent part in the worship of Minoan Crete and in
Mycenae. See Arthur Evans, <i>Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult</i>, 1901,
<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 8-12. Ramsay, <i>Cities</i>, etc., <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 91, thinks that Savazos or Sabazios
was called in Phrygia Lairbenos, which may be connected with the word
<i>Labrys</i> said to be the name of the double axe. He found a god with this
weapon worshipped together with Demeter or Cybele in the Milyan country,
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 263, 264, and he thinks the pair appear under the different
names of Leto, Artemis, Cybele, and Demeter on the one hand, and Apollo,
Lairbenos, Sabazios, Men, and Attis on the other throughout Asia Minor.
He points out, however, that they were only the male and female aspects of a
single divinity (<i>op. cit.</i> 93, 94). Is it possible that this is the explanation
of the double axe as a divine symbol? The axe with one blade was the
ordinary Egyptian word-sign for a god (see <abbr class='spell'><i>P.S.B.A</i></abbr>. 1899, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 310, 311)
and the double axe might easily mean a god with a double nature. If
this idea were at all prevalent in Anatolia at the beginning of our era, it
would explain Simon Magus’ mysterious allusion to the flaming sword of
Genesis <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 24, “which turns both ways to guard the Tree of Life,” and is
somehow connected with the division of mankind into sexes. See Hippolytus,
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 17, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 260, Cruice. A very obscure Coptic text

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r243'>243</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>That is to say: Jaldabaoth; Iao, which is probably one of the many
attempts to represent in Greek the Tetragrammaton יהוה called in English
Jehovah; Ailoaios or Eloaios, the singular of the well-known plural
name of God in Genesis אלהים “Elohim”; and Adonai, אדני, “the
Lord,” which in many parts of the <abbr class='spell'>O.T.</abbr> replaces the Tetragrammaton.
Harvey, however, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 33, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 3, thinks Iao may simply represent the
initial of the name of Yahweh coupled with Alpha and Omega to show His
eternal nature. He connects this with “I am the first and the last” of
Isaiah <abbr title='forty-four'>xliv.</abbr> 6, and <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 11. Yet the later Greeks called Dionysos Iao.

<div class='footnote' id='f247'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r247'>247</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This appears to be the sphere of the Sun to which the epithet μονότροπον
“one-formed” is not inappropriate. Why he should be called
δεσμὸν ἀβλεψίας “bond of blindness,” and λήθην ἀπερίσκεπτον “thoughtless
oblivion,” does not appear. πρώτην δύναμιν πνεύματι προνοίας καὶ
σοφίᾳ τηρουμένην “the first power preserved,” etc. coincides curiously
with what is said in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> as to the Ship of the Sun and the
“Virgin of Light.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f248'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r248'>248</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This seems to be the sphere of Saturn, the furthest or 7th reckoning
from the earth and therefore according to the astronomy of the time the
nearest to the upper heavens. Was the symbol of life the Egyptian ♀
or <i>ankh</i>? It was of course the jealous Jaldabaoth’s or Ialdabaoth’s wish
that no human souls should penetrate beyond his realm.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f249'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r249'>249</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>So the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> speaks repeatedly of the “Little Iao the Good.”
This should be the sphere of the Moon. In the hymn to Attis given in
this chapter, see <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 6, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_54'>54</a> <i>supra</i>, Attis-Dionysos-Osiris is identified with
“the holy horned moon of heaven.” and the name Iao may be connected
with the Coptic ⲒⲞϨ <i>ioh</i> or “moon.” He may be called the πρῶτος
δεσπότης θανάτου “first lord of death,” because Osiris, like Dionysos, was
the first to return to life after being torn in pieces. The φέρων ἤδη τὴν
ἰδίαν σύμβολον “bearing my own beard as a symbol” seems to refer to
the attitude of the Egyptian dead, who is represented as holding his beard
in his right hand when introduced into the presence of Osiris. See Budge,
<i>Book of the Dead</i>, 1898 (translation volume), frontispiece, or <i>Papyrus of
Ani</i>, <i>ibi cit.</i></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f250'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r250'>250</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This may be the sphere of Jupiter, who in one of the later documents
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> is made ruler of the <i>five</i> planets. Sabaoth is probably
the Divine Name צבאות “[Lord of] Hosts” which the Greeks
took for a proper name. It, like Iao, appears often in the later documents.
The πεντὰς δυνατωτέρα “mightier Pentad” may refer to the Three
Men (Adamas, his son, and Christos), and the Two Women (the First
Woman and Sophia) placed at the head of the universe by the Ophites.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f251'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r251'>251</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This should be the sphere of Mercury, the messenger of the gods
and leader of souls, who, unlike the higher powers, sees the earth from
anigh and without veils. The παρθένου πνεῦμα “spirit of a Virgin” may
be the Virgin of Light of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, who plays such an important
part in the redemption of souls. Hippolytus’ Naassene writer (Hipp.
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='five'><span class='fss'>V.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 9, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 181, Cruice) speaks of Jesus as the true gate and talks
in this connection of “Life-giving water” and of “we Christians celebrating
the mystery in the third gate”—an allusion which is unintelligible at
present, unless it refers to the waters of baptism.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f252'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r252'>252</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The sphere of Venus? The planet is said in one of the later documents
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> to be ruled by a power from “Pistis Sophia,
the daughter of Barbelo,” another name for the material antitype of the
heavenly Sophia or Mother of Life, whom we shall meet with later.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f253'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r253'>253</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The sphere of Mars? No allusion is made elsewhere to the φραγμὸν
πυρὸς “fence of fire”; but we do of course often hear of an empyrean
or heaven of fire stretching over the earth. The ζωῆς ξύλον is,
according to both Origen and Celsus, the Cross; Origen, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f254'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r254'>254</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The proper order would appear to be:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Horaios ♂ the guardian of the First Gate, <i>i.e.</i> that of Fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Ailoaios ♀ the guardian of the Second Gate, <i>i.e.</i> that of Air.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Astaphaios ☿ the guardian of the Third Gate, <i>i.e.</i> that of Water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above these we have (4) Adonai the ☉ the first power as distinguished
from mere porters or guardians of gates, (5) Iao the ☽ called in the password
the second, and (6) and (7) Sabaoth ♃ and Jaldabaoth ♄ above all. This
would about correspond with the astronomy of the time, which tried to
put the sun in the centre of our system. But the relative places of Sabaoth,
Jaldabaoth, and Ailoaios are very uncertain, and Epiphanius in describing
the Ophite sect whom he calls “Gnostics” says that some wished to make
Ialdabaoth occupy the 6th heaven, and others Ailoaios, called by him
Elilaios, while giving the 7th to Sabaoth. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> <abbr title='twenty-six'><span class='fss'>XXVI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 10, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 174,

to Jaldabaoth, ♃ ought to do the like to Suriel and Iao, ♂ to Sabaoth
(which would be appropriate enough) and to Raphael, the sun to Adonai
and Gabriel, and so on. No system of correspondences, however, can be
devised that does not break down on scrutiny. Sammael, which is here
Michael’s other name, is used in the <i>Ascensio Isaiae</i> (see Charles, <i>Ascension
of Isaiah</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 6) as a name of Satan. But it may well be that good and bad
spirits occupying corresponding places in the universe were sometimes called
by the same names. So one of the documents of the Pistis Sophia speaks
of an angel cryptically named Zarazaz “who is called by the demons after
a strong demon of their own place, Maskelli”: <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 370, Copt.</p>

puns which will be familiar to all Egyptologists (see Erman, <i>Life in Ancient

Valentinians] say that the seven heavens are endowed with intelligence
(νοητούς) and that they suppose them to be angels, and that the Demiurge
is himself an angel like God. Also that Paradise is a heaven above the
third, and that a fourth angel rules (?) there, and that from him Adam
took somewhat while talking to him. Whatever this story may mean, it is
curious to see how readily the Gnostics identified in name a heavenly place
with its ruler, as in the titles of kings and peers.</p>

Cosmocrator and all the spiritual things of evil (τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας)
were made out of the pain (λύπη) of Sophia, and that he is the creation
of the Demiurge, but knows what is above him, because he is a spirit, while
his creator is ignorant that there is anything higher than himself, because
he is only ruler of animal things (ψυχικὰ ὑπάρχοντα). In this, which is
probably the teaching of Ptolemy, Valentinus’ successor is seen to be
reverting to the Ophite ideas. Hippolytus, who here probably gives us
Valentinus’ own doctrine, says on the other hand (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 33,
<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 290, 291, Cruice): Ὥσπερ οὖν τῆς ψυχικῆς οὐσίας ἡ πρώτη καὶ μεγίστη

“As therefore the first and greatest power of the animal substance (the
Demiurge) came into being as the image of the unique son (Nous), so the
power of the material substance is the Devil, the Ruler of this world:
and Beelzebud [the power] of the substance of demons which came into
being from the perplexity” (of Sophia). It has been shown elsewhere
(<abbr class='spell'><i>P.S.B.A.</i></abbr> 1901, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 48, 49) that this Beelzebud or Beelzebuth is written
in the Magic Papyri Jabezebuth or Yahweh Sabaoth, probably in pursuance
of the parallelism which gives every god or superior power his correspondent
personality in the inferior or evil world. In all magic, mediaeval or otherwise,
Beelzebuth is carefully distinguished from Satan.</p>

“Having indeed fashioned the world, he (the Demiurge) made material
man; not taking him out of this dry earth, but from the unseen substance,
from the poured forth and liquid matter, and into him, they declare, he
breathed that which is of the soul.” Although this might be taken for a
Ptolemaic elaboration or embroidery of Valentinus’ own doctrine, it is
repeated in almost identical words in the <i>Excerpta Theodoti</i> of Clement of
Alexandria, which represent the teaching of the Oriental School, and it
is therefore possibly the statement of Valentinus himself. Hippolytus, <i>op.
cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 34, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 293, Cruice, is quite in accord with this. Irenaeus says
later (<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, § 11) with reference to the body of Jesus: καὶ ὑλικὸν δὲ
οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν εἰληφέναι λέγουσιν αὐτόν· μὴ γὰρ εἶναι τὴν ὕλην δεκτικὴν σωτηρίας.
“And they say that He took on Himself nothing whatever of matter;
for matter is not susceptible of salvation.” From which it is to be inferred
that Valentinus rejected the resurrection of the body.</p>

Joint Fruit of the Pleroma, was projected, Angels of the same kind as
himself (ὁμογενεῖς) were projected with him as a guard of honour. That
these are the spiritual spouses of the souls of men is confirmed by Hippolytus,
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 34, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 292, according to Cruice’s emendation:
Ὑποδιῄρηται δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ Ὀγδοάδι, καὶ προβεβήκασιν ἡ Σοφία, ἥτις ἐστὶ
μήτηρ πάντων τῶν ζώντων κατ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ὁ κοινὸς τοῦ Πληρώματος καρπὸς ὁ
Λόγος, [καὶ] οἵτινες εἰσὶν ἄγγελοι ἐπουράνιοι, πολιτευόμενοι ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῇ
ἄνω, τῇ ἐν οὐρανοῖς. “The things which are in the Ogdoad also are subdivided,
and there proceed (from it) Sophia who is, according to them, the
Mother of All Living, and the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma, the Logos, and
there are certain heavenly angels who are citizens of the Jerusalem which
is above, that which is in the heavens.” So later (<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 293, Cruice) ...
οἵτινές εἰσι λόγοι ἄνωθεν κατεσπαρμένοι ἀπὸ τοῦ κοινοῦ τοῦ Πληρώματος
καρποῦ καὶ τῆς Σοφίας εἰς τοῦτον τὸν κόσμον, κατοικοῦντες ἐν [σώμα]τι
χοϊκῷ μετὰ ψυχῆς, ὅταν δαίμονες μὴ συνοικῶσι τῇ ψύχῃ. “There are
certain Logoi sown from above in the world by the Joint Fruit of the
Pleroma and Sophia, which dwell in the material body with the soul, when
there are no demons dwelling with it.” Clement of Alexandria, in <i>Strom.</i>
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='five'><span class='fss'>V.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 14, points out that the notion of demons dwelling with the soul
is to be found in Plato, and quotes the passage from the Vision of Er (<i>Rep.</i>
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='ten'><span class='fss'>X.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 15) about the souls of men between births each receiving from the
hand of Lachesis a demon as their guides through life. It is more likely,
however, to have been derived from the Zoroastrian belief in the Fravashis
or Ferouers, celestial spirits who live with Ahura Mazda and the powers
of light, until they are sent on earth to be joined with the souls of men,
and to combat the powers of Ahriman (see <abbr class='spell'>L. C.</abbr> Casartelli, <span lang="fr"><i>La Philosophie

becoming intelligent spirits, shall enter unperceived and unseen within the
Pleroma, and shall be given as brides to the angels about the Saviour.”
This suggestion, which completely shocked the modesty of Tertullian, may
be connected with the Zoroastrian idea of the virgin who appears to the

“Therefore the repose of the Spirituals in [the dwelling] of the Lord,
that is, in the Ogdoad, is called the Lord’s rest” (<abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr> Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>

souls [will remain] with the Mother until the Consummation. And the
other faithful souls (will remain) with the Demiurge; and at the Consummation
they will withdraw, and they also will go into the Ogdoad.
Then will be the Wedding Feast of all those who are saved until all things
shall be made equal and all things mutually made known.” This heavenly
banquet, of which we may be quite sure Valentinus made the Marriage in
Cana a type, will be met with again in the worship of Mithras (<a href='#chap12'>Chapter <abbr title='twelve'>XII</abbr></a>,
<i>infra</i>). But it was also well known to the Orphics (see Abel’s <i>Orphica</i>,

the idea from the Persians, or the Mithraists from the Orphics?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f389'>

complicates the problem, and brings us pretty near to the Dualism of the

from Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, § 13, where it is said that when all the seed scattered

he speaks of the terror of the angels at the sight of man because of the
things which he spoke: διὰ τὸν ἀοράτως ἐν αὐτῷ σπέρμα δεδωκότα τῆς
ἄνωθεν οὐσίας, καὶ παρρησιαζόμενον “because of that within him which
yielded a germ of the substance on high, and spoke freely.” So Irenaeus,
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, § 10, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 51, Harvey: Ἔλαθεν οὖν, ὡς φασί, τὸν Δημιουργὸν ὁ

therefore, as they say, that the man whom he had formed by his breath
was at the same time made spiritual by Sophia with unspeakable power
and foresight.” So that, as Irenaeus says a few lines later, man has his
soul from the Demiurge, his body from Chaos, his fleshly part (τὸ σαρκικὸν)
from matter, and his spiritual man from the Mother, Achamoth [<i>i.e.</i> חכמת

κόσμον λύητε, ὑμεῖς δὲ καταλύησθε, κυριεύετε τῆς κτίσεως καὶ τῆς φθορᾶς ἁπάσης.
“You were deathless from the beginning and the children of life everlasting,
and you wish to share out death among you, in order that you may dissipate
and destroy it and that death may die in and by you; for when you put
an end to the world and are yourselves put an end to, you have rule over
creation and all corruption.” So one of the documents of the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> speaks of this world being finally consumed by the fire “which
the perfect wield.” It was doubtless such predictions which gave colour
to the charge of incendiarism made by the Roman authorities against
the Christians generally. For the translation of the pneumatics to the

(<abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 2, 3) about being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but “by my

In the same chapter, Hippolytus tells us that his followers were divided

led by Heracleon and Ptolemy averring that it was psychic and that at
His baptism only the πνεῦμα came upon Him as a dove, while the
Oriental School of Axionicus and Bardesanes maintained that it was
pneumatic from the first. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 2, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_116'>116</a> <i>infra</i>.</p>

relies, says (<abbr class='spell'>fr.</abbr> 78): Μέχρι τοῦ βαπτίσματος οὖν ἡ εἱμαρμένη, φασίν, ἀληθής·
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔτι ἀληθεύουσιν οἱ ἀστρολόγοι. Ἔστι δὲ οὐ τὸ λουτρὸν μόνον τὸ

ἐνεβλήθημεν, ποῦ σπεύδομεν, πόθεν λυτρούμεθα, τί γέννησις τί ἀναγέννησις.
“Until baptism then, they say the destiny [he is talking of that which is
foretold by the stars] holds good; but thereafter the astrologers’ predictions
are no longer unerring. For the [baptismal] font not only sets
us free, but is also the <i>Gnosis</i> which teaches us what we are, why we have
come into being, where we are, or whither we have been cast up, whither
we are hastening, from what we have been redeemed, why there is birth,
and why re-birth.” For baptism was to the Valentinian initiation, and a
mystagogue of Eleusis would have expressed himself no differently.</p>

between the Italic and the Oriental Schools of Valentinians, the former with
Heracleon and Ptolemy saying that the body of Jesus was an animal one,
the Holy Spirit coming on Him as a dove at His baptism, while the Orientals
with Axionicus and Bardesanes maintained that the body of the Saviour
was pneumatic or spiritual, “the Holy Spirit or Sophia and the power of
the Highest or Demiurgic art having come upon Mary, in order that what
was given to Mary might be put into form.” Apparently Valentinus was
willing to call the God of the Jews Ὕψιστος or “Highest,” which <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont
thinks was his name in Asia Minor.</p>

the emblem, perhaps the totem-animal, of the great Asiatic goddess who,
under the name of Astarte or Aphrodite, was worshipped as the <span lang="la"><i>Mater

also connected. It was doubtless to this that the text “Be ye wise as
serpents, harmless as doves” refers. Both serpents and doves figure largely
in the Mycenaean and Cretan worship of the goddess. See Ronald Burrows,

name they gave to Jesus oὐδὲ γὰρ κύριον ὀνομάζειν αὐτὸν θέλουσι “for they
do not choose to call Him Lord.” In the later part of the book, the document
called Mέρoς τευχῶν Σωτῆρος (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 253, Copt.) says that “he is
saviour and ὰχώρητος (<i>i.e.</i> not to be confined in space), who finds the words
of the mysteries and the words of the Third Receptacle which is within
(<i>i.e.</i> the inmost of the three) and excelleth them all.” From which it would
appear that the chief qualification of a saviour in the eyes of the later
Valentinians was that he was not restricted to his special place in the universe,
but could visit at will the worlds below him. We seem therefore to
be already getting near the Manichaean idea of <i>Burkhans</i> (messengers or
Buddhas) who are sent into the world for its salvation. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> <a href='#chap13'>Chapter <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr></a>

Harvey. She is, perhaps, a lower analogue of Sophia Without, and is
represented as seated in or near the material sun which is said to give its
light in its “true form” only in her τόπος or place, which is 10,000 times
more luminous than that of the Great Propator or Forefather mentioned
later (<i>Pistis Sophia</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 194, Copt.). Her function seems to be the “judging”
of the souls of the dead, which does not apparently involve any weighing
of evidence, but merely the examination of them to see what “mysteries”
they have received in previous incarnations, which will determine the
bodies in which they are reincarnated or their translation to higher spheres
(<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 239, 292). She also places in the soul a power which returns to
her, according to the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος, on the death of its possessor
(<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 284, Copt.), thereby discharging the functions assigned in the
last book of Plato’s <i>Republic</i> to Lachesis. She is also on the same authority
(<i>i.e.</i> the <abbr class='spell'>Μ. τ. Σ.</abbr>) one of the rulers of the disk of the sun and of that of the
moon (<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 340-341, Copt.), and her place is one of the “places of the
Middle” and is opposite to the kingdom of Adamas, which is called the
“head of the aeons” (<i>ibid.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 236, Copt.). She reappears in Manichaeism
and it is said in the <i>Acta Archelai</i> that at the destruction of the world she will
pass into “the ship” of the moon along with Jesus and other powers where
she will remain until the whole earth is burnt up (<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'><span class='fss'>XIII.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 21 of <i>Hegemonius,

some mistake in the reading.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f471'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r471'>471</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Barbelo is a name very frequently met with in the earlier heresiologists.
Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 26, §§ 1, 2, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 221-226, Harvey, declares that there
was a sect of Simonians called Barbeliotae “or Naassenes” who suppose
“a certain indestructible (the Latin version says ‘never-ageing’) Aeon
in a living virgin spirit whom they call Barbelo (masc.),” and gives an
account of a string of other aeons issuing not from, but at the prayer of,
this Barbelo, which is far from clear in the present state of the text. The
sect appears, from what can be made out of his description, to have resembled
the Ophites, of which it may have been a branch. Hippolytus, however,
says nothing of them, and the account of Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> <abbr title='twenty-five'><span class='fss'>XXV.</span></abbr> and <abbr title='twenty-six'><span class='fss'>XXVI.</span></abbr>,
<abbr title='volume'>Vol.</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II</span></abbr>, <abbr title='part'>pt</abbr> 1, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 160, 184), Oehler, is untrustworthy, inasmuch as he assigns
the worship of Barbelo to two sects, one of which he calls Nicolaitans and
the other Gnostics simply. To both of them he attributes after his manner
unimaginably filthy rites, and it is plain from his making Barbelo the mother
of Jaldabaoth and giving her a seat in the eighth heaven that he confuses
her wilfully or otherwise with the Sophia of the Ophites. Her place in the
system of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> will be described in the text. The name is said
by Harvey to be derived from the Syriac <i>Barba elo</i>, the Deity in Four or God
in Tetrad, and the derivation is approved by Hort (<i>Dict. of Christian Biog.</i>
<abbr class='spell'><i>s.h.n.</i></abbr>). It appears more likely, however, that it is to be referred to the
Hebrew root בבל “Babel” or confusion, a derivation which Hort also mentions.
In Irenaeus’ Greek text the name is spelt βαρβηλὼ, in the Latin
“Barbelo” with an accusative “Barbelon,” and in Epiphanius βαρβηλὼ
and βαρβήρω. If we might alter this last into βαρβαριωθ, we might see
it in a great: number of magic spells of the period. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Wessely, <i>Ephesia

<i>rachama</i>, <i>ôzai</i>. Whatever they may mean, we may be quite sure that they
can never contain with their few letters the three pages or so of text which
are given as their interpretation. It is possible that the letters are used
acrostically like the <abbr class='spell'>A G L A</abbr>, <i>i.e.</i> ניבר לעולם אדני (? Ahih ? אהיה) אתה <span lang="he"><i>Ate
Gibor Lailam Adonai</i></span>, “The mighty Adonai for ever” (or “thou art the

notable feature in these mysterious words is the quantity of Zetas or ζ’s that
they contain which points to the use of some sort of table like that called
by Cabalists <i>ziruph</i>, or a cryptogram of the <abbr class='spell'><i>aaaaa</i>, <i>aaaab</i></abbr>, kind. It should
be noticed that Coptic scribes were often afflicted with what has been
called Betacism or the avoidance of the letter Beta or β by every means,
which frequently led to the substitution for it of ζ as in the case of Jaldabaoth

conception of the Supreme Being as the Man κατ’ ἐξοχήν, which we have

So in the system of Marcus referred to in <a href='#chap09'><abbr title='chapter'>Chap.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr></a> <i>supra</i>, Irenaeus (<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>
<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 8, § 11, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 146, Harvey) explains that the name of Jesus (Ἰησοῦς)
which might be uttered is composed of six letters, but His unutterable
name of twenty-four, because the names of the first Tetrad of Ἄρρητος
(Bythos), Σιγή, Πατὴρ (Monogenes or Nous) and Ἀλήθεια contain that
number of letters. See also § 5 of same chapter. Those who wish to
understand the system are recommended to read the whole of the chapter
quoted. As Irenaeus has the sense to see, there is no reason why the
construction from one root of names founded on the principle given should
not go on for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r475'>475</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This is probably either the Horos or Stauros that we have seen brought
into being in the teaching of Valentinus as a guard to the Pleroma, or, as
is more probable, an antitype of the same power in the world immediately
above ours. That there was more than one Horos according to the later
Valentinians appears plain from the words of Irenaeus above quoted
(see <a href='#chap09'><abbr title='chapter'>Chap.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr></a>, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_105'>105</a> <i>supra</i>). Probably each world had its Horos,
or Limit, who acted as guard to it on its completion. That in this world,
the Cross, personified and made pre-existent, fulfils this office seems evident
from the Gospel of Peter, where it is described as coming forth from the

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r476'>476</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Ὁ μηνευτος. The word is not known in classical Greek (but <abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr>
μηνυτής “a revealer”), and appears to have its root in μήν “the moon,”
as the <i>measure</i> of the month. From the Coptic word here translated
“Precept,” we may guess it to be a personification of the Jewish Law or
<i>Torah</i> which, according to the Rabbis, before the creation of the world
existed in the heavens. Later in the book it is said that it is by command
of this power that Jeû places the aeons (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 26, Copt.); that the souls of those
who receive the mysteries of the light (<i>i.e.</i> the psychics) will have precedence
in beatitude over those who belong to the places of the First Precept
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 196, Copt.); that all the orders of beings of the Third χὠρημα are
below him (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 203, Copt.); and that he is “cut into seven mysteries,”
which may mean that his name is spelled with seven letters (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 219, Copt.).</p>

prototype of our sun. Elsewhere in the book, Jesus tells His disciples
that He brought forth from Himself “at the beginning” power (not <i>a</i>
power), which He cast into the First Precept, “and the First Precept cast
part of it into the Great Light, and the Great Light cast part of that which
he received into the Five Parastatae, the last of whom breathed part of that
which he received into the Kerasmos or Confusion” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 14, Copt.). The
Great Light is also called the Χάραγμα of the Light, and is said to have
remained without emanation (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 219, Copt.).</p>

can here hardly be anything else but the Five Planets. It is said later
that it was the last Parastates who set Jeû and his five companions in
the “Place of the Right Hand” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 193, Copt.). When the world is destroyed,
Jesus is to take the perfect souls into this last Parastates where
they are to reign with him (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 230, Copt.) for 1000 years of light which are
365,000 of our years (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 243, Copt.). Προηγούμενος “Forerunner” does

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r480'>480</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>We hear nothing more definite of these Five Trees, but they appear

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r481'>481</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This is a most puzzling expression and seems to have baffled the scribe,
as he speaks of them, when he comes to repeat the phrase (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 216, Copt.),
as the “Twin Saviours,” which is a classical epithet of the Dioscuri. In
Pharaonic Egypt, Shu and Tefnut the pair of gods who were first brought
into being by the Creator were sometimes called “The Twins.” See
Naville, <i>Old Egyptian Faith</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 120. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_171'>171</a> <i>infra</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f482'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r482'>482</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>It is evident from the context that we here begin the enumeration
of the Powers of the Left, who are hylic or material and therefore the least
worthy of the inhabitants of the heavens. According to Irenaeus, the
Valentinians held that all of them were doomed to destruction. Τριῶν ὠν
ὄντων, τὸ μὲν ὑλικὸν, ὃ καὶ ἀριστερὸν καλοῦσι, κατὰ ἀνάγκην ἀπὸλλυσθαι
λέγουσιν, ἅτε μηδεμίαν ἐπιδέξασθαι πνοὴν ἀφθαρσίας δυνάμενον
(Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, § 11, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 51, Harvey). “There being three forms of
existences, they say that the hylic, which they call the left hand, must be
destroyed, inasmuch as it cannot receive any breath of incorruption.”
So in the Bruce Papyrus to be presently mentioned, the “part of the left”
is called the land of Death. At their head stands “the Great Unseen
Propator,” who throughout the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> proper is called by this title
only, and occupies the same place with regard to the left that Iao does in
respect of the middle, and Jeû of the right. In the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 359, Copt.) he is called by the name ἀγραμμαχαμαρεχ which
frequently appears in the Magic Papyri. It is there spelt indifferently
ακραμνικαμαρι, ακραμμαχαρι, ακραμμαχαμαρει, ακραμμαχαχαχαρι, and in a
Latin inscription on a gold plate, <i>acramihamari</i> (see Wessely, <i>Ephesia
Grammata</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 22, for references), which last may be taken to be the
more usual pronunciation. One is rather tempted to see in the name a
corruption of ἀγραμματέον in the sense of “which cannot be written,”
but I can find no authority for such a use of the word. As the ruler of the
material Cosmos he might be taken for the Cosmocrator who, as we have
seen, is called by Valentinus Diabolos or the Devil (but see <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_152'>152</a>
<i>infra</i>). Yet he cannot be wholly evil like Beelzebuth for it is said in the
text (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 41, Copt.) that he and his consort Barbelo sing praises to the Powers
of the Light. So in the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 378, Copt.)
he is represented as begging for purification and holiness when the Great
Name of God is uttered. It is plain also from the statements in the text
(<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 43, 44, Copt.) that in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> he, Barbelo, and the Αὐθάδης
or Arrogant Power make up a triad called the great τριδυναμεῖς or
“Triple Powers” from whom are projected the powers called the “Twenty-four
Invisibles.” In another document of the same <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 361, Copt.) a
power from him is said to be bound in the planet Saturn.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r483'>483</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This Εἱμαρμένη or “Destiny” is the sphere immediately above
our firmament. It is evidently so called, because on passing through it
the soul on its way to incarnation receives the Moira or impress of its own
destiny, of which it cannot afterwards rid itself except by the grace of the
mysteries or Valentinian sacraments. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> <a href='#chap09'><abbr title='chapter'>Chap.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr></a>, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 3, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_115'>115</a> <i>supra</i>.</p>

Aeons in the world above was only 12, it is difficult to say. But Hippolytus

what they say. But besides this, they make their whole teaching
arithmetical, since they say that the thirty Aeons within the Pleroma again
projected by analogy other Aeons, so that thereby the Pleroma may be
gathered together in a perfect number. For the manner in which the
Pythagoreans divide [the cosmos] into 12, 30, and 60 parts, and each of
these into yet more minute ones, has been made plain” [see <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr>

a single principle by a succession of odd and even or male and female numbers,
in connection with which he quotes Simon Magus (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 132,

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r501'>501</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Jeû is generally called the ἐπίσκοπος or overseer of the Light. He
it is who has placed the Rulers of the Aeons so that they always “behold
the left” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 26, Copt.). He is also said to have bound “in the beginning”
the rulers of the Aeons and of Destiny and of the Sphere in their respective
places (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 34, Copt.), and that each and every of them will remain in the
τάξις or order and walk in the δρόμος or course in which he placed
them. We also hear in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> proper of two “books of Jeû”
“which Enoch wrote when the First Mystery spoke with him out of the
Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge in the Paradise of Adam” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 246,

described as “the First Man, the ἐπίσκοπος of the Light, and the
πρεσβευτής or Ambassador of the First Precept” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 322, Copt.); and
it is further said in the same book that “the Book of Jeû (not books)
which Enoch wrote in Paradise when I (Jesus) spoke with him out of the
Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge” was placed by His means in “the
rock Ararad.” Jesus goes on to say that He placed “Kalapataurôth the
ruler who is over Skemmut in which is the foot of Jeû, and he surrounds
all rulers and destinies—I placed that ruler to guard the books of Jeû from
the Flood and lest any of the rulers should destroy them out of envy”

he is, it is always as the great παραλήμπτωρ or “inheritor” of the Light
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 34, Copt.). Jesus describes how he comes among the Rulers of the Aeons
at certain times and takes away their light, which he purifies (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 35, Copt.).
He is said to have emanated from the light of the 5th Tree of the Treasure
House, as Jeû did from that of the 1st (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 193, Copt.). In the Μέρος
τευχῶν Σωτῆρος, he is called the great παραλημπτής or “receiver” of the Light
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 292, Copt.). In the 2nd part of the last named document he is called
Zorocothora Melchizidek, an epithet which <abbr class='spell'>C. W.</abbr> King in <i>The Gnostics and
their Remains</i> translates “light-gatherer.” It is also said in the same 2nd
part that “he and Jeû are the two great lights,” and that he is the πρεσβευτής
or “Legate” of all the lights which are purified in the Rulers of the Aeons
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 365, Copt.). We may perhaps see in him and Jeû the antitypes of
which the Great Light and the First Precept are the paradigms. Hippolytus,

of one Theodotus, a τραπεζίτης or money-changer, who said that
there was “a greatest power named Melchizidek who was greater than
Christ.” Pseudo-Tertullian repeats the same story and adds that Melchizidek
is “a celestial virtue of great grace,” who does for heavenly angels
and virtues what Christ does for men, having made himself “their
intercessor and advocate.” See <i>auct. cit.</i> (probably Victorinus of Pettau)

is this last who takes the power from the Great Sabaoth the Good which
afterwards becomes the body of Jesus and “casts it into matter and
Barbelo” (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 127, Copt.). He seems to be set over or in some way identified
with what is called the Gate of Life (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 215, Copt.) both in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>

If we had more documents of the style of Simon’s <i>Apophasis</i>, we should
probably find that this apposition of two or more nouns in a name was
not infrequent, and the case of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris will occur to every
Egyptologist. The fact that the name includes the first and last female
member of the Dodecad of Valentinus (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_101'>101</a> <i>supra</i>) is really its most
plausible explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f522'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r522'>522</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This Adamas seems to be an essentially evil power, who wages useless
war against the Light on the entry of Jesus into his realm (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 25, Copt.).
His seat is plainly the Twelve Aeons or Zodiac (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 157, Copt.), and it is said
in the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος that his “kingdom” is in the τοποι κεφαλης
αἰωνων or Places of the head of the Aeons and is opposite the place of the
Virgin of Light (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 336, Copt.). In the second part of the same document
(<i>i.e.</i> the <abbr class='spell'>μ. τ. σ.</abbr>) it is said that the rulers of Adamas rebelled, persisting in the
act of copulation (συνουσία) and begetting “Rulers and Archangels and
Angels and Ministers (λειτουργοί) and Decans” (Δεκανοί), and that thereupon
Jeû went forth from the Place of the Right and “bound them in Heimarmene
and the Sphere.” We further learn that half the Aeons headed by Jabraoth,
who is also once mentioned in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> proper (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 128, Copt., and
again in the Bruce Papyrus, Amélineau, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 239), were consequently transferred
to another place, while Adamas, now for the first time called Sabaoth
Adamas, with the unrepentant rulers are confined in the Sphere to the
number of 1800, over whom 360 other rulers bear sway, over whom again are
set the five planets Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 360, 361,
Copt.). All this seems to me to be later than the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> proper, to
have been written at a time when belief in astrology was more rife than in
Hadrian’s reign, and to owe something to Manichaean influence. The original
Adamas, the persecutor of Pistis Sophia herself, seems identifiable with the
Diabolos or Cosmocrator of Valentinus, in which case we may perhaps see
in the “Great Propator” a merely stupid and ignorant power like the
Jaldabaoth of the Ophites and their successors. See <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_163'>163</a> <i>infra</i>.</p>

Jesus to Mary that a year is as a day (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 243, Copt.). But all the astrology of
the time seems to have divided the astronomical day not into 24, but into
12 hours. It was the same with the Manichaeans. See Chavannes and
Pelliot, <span lang="fr">“Un Traité manichéen retrouvé en Chine,”</span> <i>Journal Asiatique</i>,

Ages, the Manichaeans of Languedoc did not allow their “Perfects” to
partake of animal food nor even of eggs, but allowed them fish, because
they said these creatures were not begotten by copulation. See Schmidt,
<span lang="fr"><i>Hist. des Cathares</i></span>, Paris, 1843. Is this one of the reasons why Jesus is

that assigned him by the Ophites. In the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος he
sinks lower still and becomes merely one of the torturers in hell (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 382,
Copt., <abbr class='spell'>κ.τ.λ.</abbr>). Thus, as is usual in matters of religion, the gods of one age
become the fiends of the next. In the Bruce Papyrus (Amélineau, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 212)
he appears as one of the chiefs of the Third Aeon. It is curious, however,
to observe how familiar the name must have been to what Origen calls
“a certain secret theology,” so that it was necessary to give him <i>some</i> place
in every system of Gnosticism. His bipartite appearance may be taken
from Ezekiel <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 2.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f534'>

<abbr class='spell'><i>J.Q.R.</i></abbr>, 1895, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 590. Death, as we have seen in <a href='#chap09'><abbr title='chapter'>Chap.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr></a>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>, was in

<div class='footnote' id='f538'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r538'>538</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>These “three times” are not years. As the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> opens with
the announcement that Jesus spent 12 years on earth after the Resurrection,
we may suppose that He was then—if the author accepted the traditional
view that He suffered at 33—exactly 45 years old, and the “time” would
then be a period of 15 years, as was probably the indiction. The descent
of the “two vestures” upon Jesus is said (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 4, Copt.) to have taken place
“on the 15th day of the month Tybi” which is the day Clement of Alexandria
(<i>Strom.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 21) gives for the birth of Jesus. He says the followers

is trying to make out that well-known passages of both the Old and New
Testaments were in fact prophetic utterances showing forth in advance the
marvels he narrates. While the Psalms of David quoted by him are Canonical,
the Odes of Solomon are the Apocrypha known under that name and
quoted by Lactantius (<i>Div. Inst.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='four'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 12). For some time the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i> was the only authority for their contents, but in 1909 Dr Rendel
Harris found nearly the whole collection in a Syriac <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> of the 16th century.

<abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr> <abbr title='number'>No.</abbr> 3, Cambridge, 1912, by the Bishop of Ossory, who shows, as

therefore put their date about the year 200. This would be after the time
of Valentinus himself, but agrees well with what <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont (<i>Astrology and
Religion</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 96 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>) says as to the great vogue which astrology attained
in Rome under the Severi. Its intrusion into the Valentinian doctrines

ὅπερ εἶχεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ κάλλιστον καὶ ἀνθηρότατον συνενεγκαμένους καὶ ἐρανισαμένους,

Pleroma of the Aeons, with the consent of Christos and the Spirit, and their
Father having set his seal upon the motion, brought together and combined
what each of them had in him which was most beautiful and brightest, and
wreathing these fittingly together and properly uniting them, they projected
a projection to the honour and glory of Bythos, the most perfect beauty
and star of the Pleroma, the perfect Fruit Jesus, who is also called Saviour
and Christ, and after his Father Logos, and Pan, because He is from
all.” Compare with these the words of Colossians <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 9: ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ
κατοικεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος σωματικῶς. “For in him dwelleth
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r545'>545</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>That the Valentinians considered the Dodecad (and <span lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> the Decad)
as having a collective entity, and as it were a corporate existence, seems
plain from what Hippolytus says in narrating the opinions of Marcus:
ταῦτα γὰρ δώδεκα ζώδια φανερώτατα τὴν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου καὶ τῆς Ἐκκλησίας
θυγατέρα δωδεκάδα ἀποσκιάζειν λέγουσι. “For they say that these 12 signs
of the Zodiac most clearly shadow forth the Dodecad who is the daughter
of Anthropos and Ecclesia” (Hipp. <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='six'><span class='fss'>VI.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 54, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 329, Cruice).
And again (<i>loc. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 331, Cruice): ἔτι μὴν καὶ τὴν γῆν εἰς δώδεκα κλίματα
διῃρῆσθαι φάσκοντες, καὶ καθ’ ἒν ἕκαστον κλίμα, ἀνὰ μίαν δύναμιν ἐκ τοῦ
οὐρανῶν κατὰ κάθετον ὑποδεχομένην, καὶ ὁμοούσια τίκτουσαν τέκνα τῇ καταπεμπούσῃ
κατὰ τὴν ἀπόρροιαν δυνάμει, τύπον εἶναι τῆς ἄνω δωδεκάδος. “These
are also they who assert that the earth is divided into twelve climates, and
receives in each climate one special power from the heavens and produces
children resembling the power thus sent down by emanation, being thus a
type of the Dodecad above.” The doctrine of correspondences or, as it
was called in the Middle Ages, of “signatures” is here most clearly stated.
In all this the Valentinian teaching was doubtless under the influence of the
ancient Egyptian ideas as to the <i>paut neteru</i> or “company of the gods,”
as to which see Maspero’s essay <span lang="fr"><i>Sur L’Ennéade</i></span> quoted above.</p>

<i>supra</i>, there is no passage but one in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> which affords any
colour for supposing that the author was acquainted with <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> John’s Gospel.
All the quotations set forth by Harnack in his treatise <span lang="de"><i>Über das gnostische
Buch Pistis-Sophia</i></span>, Leipzig, 1891, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 27, on which he relies to prove the
converse of this proposition, turn out on analysis to appear also in one or
other of the Synoptics, from which the author may well have taken them.
The single exception is this (<i>Pistis Sophia</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 11, Copt.), “Wherefore I
said unto you from the beginning, Ye are not from the Cosmos; I likewise
am not from it”; John <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 14: “(O Father) I have given them thy word;
and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world.” The parallel does not seem so close as to make
it certain that one document is copying from the other. Both may very
possibly be taken from some collection of Logia now lost, but at one
time current in Alexandrian circles; or from the <i>Gospel of the Egyptians</i>,
from which the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> afterwards quotes.</p>

was not before that event. Jesus also promises her later (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 168, Copt.)
that when the three times are fulfilled and the <i>Authades</i> is again wroth with
her and tries to stir up Jaldabaoth and Adamas against her “I will take
away their powers from them and give them to thee.” That this promise
was supposed to be fulfilled seems evident from the low positions which
Jaldabaoth and Adamas occupy in the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος, while Pistis
Sophia is said to furnish the “power” for the planet Venus.</p>

that Agape or Love makes Faith, Hope, and Charity. But I believe it
to be more likely that the “12 mysteries” are letters in a word. So in
the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος it is said of the “Dragon of the Outer Darkness,”
which is in fact the worst of all the hells described in that book: “And
the Dragon of the Outer Darkness hath twelve true (αὐθέντη) names
which are in his gates, a name according to each gate of the torture-chambers.
And these names differ one from the other, but they belong to
each of the twelve, so that he who saith one name, saith all the names.
And these I will tell you in the Emanation of the Universe”—(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 323,
Copt.). If this be thought too trivial an explanation, Irenaeus tells us that
the 18 Aeons remaining after deducting the Decad or Dodecad (as the case
may be) from the rest of the Pleroma were, according to the Valentinians,
signified by the two first letters of the name of Jesus: ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τῶν
προηγουμένων τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ δύο γραμμάτων, τοῦ τε ἰῶτα καὶ τοῦ ἦτα, τοὺς
δεκαοκτὼ Αἰῶνας εὐσήμως μηνύεσθαι, Irenaeus, <abbr title='book'>Βk</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, § 5, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 26, Harvey.
Equally absurd according to modern ideas are the words of the <i>Epistle
of Barnabas</i> (<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 23, 24, Hilgenfeld), where after quoting a verse in
Genesis about Abraham circumcising 318 of his slaves (<abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr> <abbr title='genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 14),
the author says “What then is the knowledge (γνῶσις) given therein?
Learn that the 18 were first, and then after a pause, he says 300. (In)
the 18, <abbr class='spell'>I</abbr> = 10, <abbr class='spell'>H</abbr> = 8, thou hast Jesus (Ἰησοῦν). And because the Cross
was meant to have grace in the <abbr class='spell'>T</abbr>, he says also 300. He expresses therefore
Jesus by two letters and the Cross by one. He knows who has placed
in us the ungrafted gift of teaching. None has learned from me a more
genuine word. But I know that ye are worthy.”</p>

that is the Decad. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> especially the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 377,

female, nor male, nor shape in that Place, but there is Light, everlasting,

(<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 255 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr> Copt.), where the disciples are ordered to “preach to the whole
world ... renounce (ἀποτασσετε) the whole world and all the matter
which is therein, and all its cares and all its sins, and in a word all its conversation
(ὁμιλιαι) which is therein, that ye may be worthy of the

hardly be they, although Jesus calls them in one place (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 374, Copt.),
“the mysteries of the light which remit sins, which themselves are appellations
and names of light.” These are administered to the twelve disciples
without distinction, and it is evident that the author of these books is quite
unacquainted with any division into pneumatic and psychic, and knows
nothing of the higher mysteries called in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> proper “the
mysteries of the Ineffable One” and “the mysteries of the First Mystery.”
We should get over many difficulties if we supposed the two later books to
be Marcosian in origin, but in any event they are later than the <i>Pistis
Sophia</i>.</p>

Fatherhood, boundless light” with which this part of the <abbr class='spell'>Μ. τ. σ.</abbr> opens, we
can, with a little good will, identify nearly every word of the “galimatias”
which at first sight seems mere gibberish. Thus, the whole invocation reads:
αεηιουω, ϊαω, αωϊ, οϊαψινωθερ, θερ[ι]νοψ, νωψιθερ, ζαγουρη, παγουρη, νεθμομαωθ,
νεψιομαωθ, μαραχαχθα, θωβαρραβαυ, θαρναχαχαν, ζοροκοθορα Ιεου Σαβαωθ.
The seven vowels to which many mystical interpretations have been
assigned, and which have even been taken for a primitive system of musical
notation (<abbr class='spell'>C. E.</abbr> Ruelle, <span lang="fr">“Le Chant des Sept Voyelles Grecques,” <i>Rev. des
Ét. Grecques</i></span>, Paris, 1889, <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 43, and <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 393-395), probably express the
sound to Greek ears of the Jewish pronunciation of Yahweh or Jehovah.
The word Iao we have before met with many times both as a name of
Dionysos and otherwise, and is here written anagrammatically from the
difficulty which the Greeks found in dealing with Semitic languages written
the reverse way to their own. The word ψινωθερ which follows and is also
written as an anagram is evidently an attempt to transcribe in Greek letters
the Egyptian words <abbr class='spell'><i>P</i></abbr>, <i>Shai</i>, <i>neter</i> (<abbr class='spell'><i>P</i></abbr> = <abbr title='definite'>Def.</abbr> article, <i>Shai</i> = the Egyptian God
of Fate whose name Revillout, <i>Rev. Égyptol.</i> Paris, 1892, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 29-38, thinks
means “The Highest,” and <i>neter</i> or <i>nuter</i> the determinative for “god”),
the whole reading “Most High God.” The words ζαγουρη παγουρη (better,
πατουρη) are from the Hebrew roots סגר פטר and seem to be the “he that
openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth and no man openeth” of
<abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 7. Νεθμομαωθ, which is often found in the Magic Papyri, is reminiscent
of the Egyptian <i>neb maat</i> “Lord of Truth,” the following νεψιομαωθ
being probably a variant by a scribe who was uncertain of the orthography.
Μαραχαχθα I can make nothing of, although as the phrase νεφθομαωθ
μαραχαχθα appears in the Magic Papyrus of Leyden generally called
<abbr class='spell'>W</abbr> (Leemans, <i>Papyri Graeci</i>, etc. <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 154) in a spell there said to be written
by “Thphe the Hierogrammateus” for “Ochus the king,” it is evidently
intended for Egyptian. In the same spell appear the words θαρνμαχαχ
ζοροκοθορα and θωβαρραβαυ which are evidently the same as those
in the <abbr class='spell'>Μ. τ. σ.</abbr>, and of which I will only say that, while Mr King supposes
ζοροκοθορα to mean “light-gatherer,” θωβαρραβαυ is in the leaden <span lang="la"><i>tabula

because they are pure light,” which are made the “interpretation” of the
text: “They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that
are sick.” See also the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 246, Copt., where it is said of the
mysteries promised by Jesus that “they lead every race of men inwards
into the highest places according to the χωρημα of the inheritance, so that

in the two books of Jeû which Enoch wrote etc.”</p>

he is taken to the Virgin of Light, who sets him before the Little Sabaoth the

Harvey), “that name of the Saviour which may be pronounced, <i>i.e.</i> Jesus,
is composed of six letters, but His ineffable name of 24.” The cryptogram
in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> is in these words (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 125, Copt.): “These are the names
which I will give thee from the Boundless One downwards. Write them
with a sign that the sons of God may show them forth of this place. This
is the name of the Deathless One ααα ωωω, and this is the name of
the word by which the Perfect Man is moved: ιιι. These are the
interpretations of the names of the mysteries. The first is <abbr class='spell'>ααα</abbr>, the
interpretation of which is <abbr class='spell'>φφφ</abbr>. The second which is <abbr class='spell'>μμμ</abbr> or which
is <abbr class='spell'>ωωω</abbr>, its interpretation is <abbr class='spell'>ααα</abbr>. The third is <abbr class='spell'>ψψψ</abbr>, its interpretation
is <abbr class='spell'>οοο</abbr>. The fourth is <abbr class='spell'>φφφ</abbr>, its interpretation is <abbr class='spell'>ννν</abbr>. The
fifth is <abbr class='spell'>δδδ</abbr>, its interpretation is <abbr class='spell'>ααα</abbr>, which above the throne is <abbr class='spell'>ααα</abbr>.
This is the interpretation of the second <abbr class='spell'>αααα, αααα, αααα</abbr>, which is the
interpretation of the whole name.” The line drawn above the three
Alphas and Omegas is used in the body of the text to denote words in a
foreign (<i>i.e.</i> non-Egyptian) language such as Hebrew; but in the Papyrus
Bruce about to be described, the same letters without any line above are
given as the name of “the Father of the Pleroma.” See Amélineau’s text,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 113. The “moving” of the image (πλάσμα) of the Perfect Man is
referred to in Hippolytus (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 144, Cruice). That the Tetragrammaton
was sometimes written by Jewish magicians with three Jods
or <abbr class='spell'><i>i.i.i.</i></abbr> see Gaster, <i>The Oldest Version of Midrash Megillah</i>, in Kohut’s
Semitic Studies, Berlin, 1897, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 172. So on a magic cup in the Berlin
Museum, conjuration is made “in the name of Jahve the God of Israel

(Stübe, <span lang="de"><i>Judisch-Babylonische Zaubertexte</i></span>, Halle, 1895, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 23-27). For the

<abbr title='band'>Bd</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> Leipzig, 1905. His arrangement of the papyrus leaves makes much
better sense than that of Amélineau, but it is only arrived at by eliminating
all passages which seem to be inconsequent and attributing them to separate
works. The fragments which he distinguishes as A and B and describes
as <span lang="de">“gnostischen Gebetes,”</span> certainly appear to form part of those which

make matter the creation of God, but the author gets out of the dilemma
by affirming (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 126) that “that which was not was the evil which
is manifested in matter” and that while that which exists is called αἰώνιος,

command of the First Mystery placed Jeû, Melchisedek, and four other
powers in the τόπος of those who belong to the right hand πρός οἰκονομίας
of the Assembly of the Light. There, as here, it doubtless means that
they were arranged in the same order as the powers above them in
pursuance of the principle that “that which is above is like that which
is below,” or, in other words, of the doctrine of correspondences.
From the Gnostics the word found its way into Catholic theology, as when
Tertullian (<i>adv. Praxean</i>, <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 3) says that the majority of simple-minded

time of the Pyramid-Builders, were supposed to possess immortality as
being gods even in their lifetime. Later, the gift was extended to rulers
of nomes and other rich men, and finally to all those who could purchase the
spells that would assure it. In Maspero’s words <span lang="fr">“La vie d’au delà n’était
pas un droit pour l’Égyptien: il pouvait la gagner par la vertu des formules
et des pratiques, mais il pouvait aussi bien la perdre, et s’il était pauvre
ou isolé, les chances étaient qu’il la perdit à bref délai”</span> (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 174).</p>

the natural and appointed end of Gnosticism, which according to him was
“rotten before it was ripe.” “It presents,” he says, “all the features
which we shall find to be characteristic of degenerate mysticism. Not to
speak of its oscillations between fanatical austerities and scandalous licence,
and its belief in magic and other absurdities, we seem, when we read
Irenaeus’ description of a Valentinian heretic, to hear the voice of Luther
venting his contempt upon some <i>Geisterer</i> of the sixteenth century.” It
may be so; yet, after all, Gnosticism in its later developments lasted for a
longer time than the doctrines of Luther have done, particularly in the
land of their birth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r751'>751</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Eznig of Goghp, from whose History of the Armenian Church quotation
has been made above. He says that Marcion taught that there were
three heavens, in the highest of which dwelt the Good God, in the next
the God of the (Jewish) Law, and in the third his angels. Below this lay
Hyle or Matter who existed independently and was female. From the
union of the God of the Law and Hyle, this earth was produced, after
which its Father retired to his own heaven, leaving the earth to the rule
of Hyle. When he desired to make man, Hyle supplied the dust of which
he was formed, into which the God of the Law breathed his own spirit.
Adam became the adorer of Hyle, upon which the God of the Law informed
him that, if he worshipped any other God but him, he should die. On
this Adam withdrew from Hyle, and this last, becoming jealous, made a
number of gods and filled the world with them. Hence all men were cast
into hell at death, until the Good God looked down from the highest
heaven, had pity on them, and sent his Son to deliver the “spirits in
prison,” which He did directly He went down into hell after His own death.
After Jesus had revealed Himself to the Creator and received his confession
of ignorance, Jesus illuminated Paul and made him His apostle. It is
extremely unlikely that this story should have formed part of Marcion’s
own teaching, although it may possibly have been told by some follower
of his of Semitic blood, or, as Salmon suggests, by Cerdo. It is to be found
in Neumann’s translation of Eznig in the <span lang="de"><i>Zeitschr. für hist. Theol.</i></span> <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='four'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr>

Damascius from a certain Eudemos who may or may not be Eudemos of
Rhodes (Alexander’s contemporary) that, “of the Magi and all the warrior
[or Medic: ἄρειον] race some call the intelligible” [<i>i.e.</i> that which can be
apprehended by the mind only and not by the senses] “and united
universe Topos (place), while others of them call it Chronos (Time), and
that from this universe are to be distinguished a good God and evil demon;
or as some say, prior to these, Light and Darkness.” “Both the one and
the other school therefore,” Damascius goes on, “after the undivided
Nature, make the double series of the higher powers distinct from one
another, of one of which they make Oromasdes the leader, and of the
other Arimanius.” It seems evident from the above words, that only a
certain sect of the Magi in the time of this Eudemos put Time at the head
of their pantheon. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Cory’s <i>Ancient Fragments</i>, 1832, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 318, 319.</p>

principle of its own,” so that it cannot be the work of a benevolent being.
As he is generally supposed to have taken his account of the Persian
teaching from Theopompos of Chios, who was at the Court of Ptolemy
about 305 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, his evidence is against those who, like <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, would
make the “Zervanist” opinion, which assumes a common principle for
good and evil, pre-Christian. Yet the point does not yet seem capable
of decision, as Plutarch <i>may</i> here be only giving us his own opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1041'>1041</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This is really the <i>crux</i> of the whole question. If the idea could be
traced back to the philosophers of Ionia (<i>e.g.</i> Heraclitus of Ephesus) and
their theory of eternal strife and discord being the cause of all mundane
phenomena, it is difficult to say whence the Ionians themselves derived it,
save from Persia. We can, of course, suppose, if we please, that the
Persians did not invent it <i>de novo</i>, but took it over from some of their
subjects. Among these, the Babylonians, for instance, from the earliest
times portrayed their demons as not only attempting to invade the heaven
of the gods, but as being in perpetual warfare with one another. But
the very little we know of Babylonian philosophy would lead us to think
that it inclined towards pantheism of a materialistic kind rather than to
dualism.</p>

Yet the nearest
source from which Manes could have borrowed the idea is certainly Bardesanes,
who, according to Bar Khôni and another Syriac author, taught
that the world was made from five substances, <i>i.e.</i> fire, air, water, light
and darkness. See Pognon, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 178; Cumont, <span lang="fr"><i>La Cosmogonie

ancients were unacquainted with the properties of gases, it is singular that
they should have formed such a conception as that of the compressibility
and expansibility of spirits. Yet the idea is a very old one, and the Arabian
Nights story of the Genius imprisoned in a brass bottle has its parallel in
the bowls with magical inscriptions left by the Jews on the site of Babylon
(Layard, <i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>, 1853, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 509 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>), between pairs of which
demons were thought to be imprisoned. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Pognon, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 3. Something

But here the Christian tradition gives more details than the Mahommedan.
Hegemonius, <i>Acta</i>, <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'><span class='fss'>VII.</span></abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 10, Beeson, and Bar Khôni (Pognon, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 185),
are in accord that the God of Light produced from himself a new Power
called the Μήτηρ τῆς Ζωῆς or Mother of Life, that this Mother of Life projected
the First Man, and that the First Man produced the five elements
called also his “sons,” to wit, wind, light, water, fire and air, with which
he clothed himself as with armour. See Cumont, <i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 16,
<abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 4, for the harmonizing of the texts [<abbr class='spell'>N.B.</abbr> the omission of πῦρ from his
quotation from the <i>Acta</i> is doubtless a clerical error]. The identification
of the Mother of Life with the “Spirit of the Right [Hand]” is accepted by
Bousset, <i>Hauptprobleme</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 177, 178, and may be accounted for by the
crude figure by which the Egyptians explained the coming-forth of the
universe from a single male power. See Budge, <i>Hieratic Papyri in the
Brit. Mus.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 17.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1051'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1051'>1051</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>These were also the “sons” of Darkness or Satan. See Bar Khôni
(Pognon, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 186). The reason that led the God of Light to send a champion
into the lists was, according to Bar Khôni (Pognon, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 185), that the five
worlds of his creation were made for peace and tranquillity and could
therefore not help him directly in the matter. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine, <span lang="la"><i>de Natura
Boni</i></span>, <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-two'><span class='fss'>XLII.</span></abbr> But Manes doubtless found it necessary to work into his
system the figure of the First Man which we have already seen prominent
in the Ophite system. Cumont, <i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 16, says few conceptions
were more widely spread throughout the East. It is fully examined
by Bousset, <i>Hauptprobleme</i>, in his <abbr title='fourth'><span class='fss'>IV</span>th</abbr> chapter, <span lang="de">“Der Urmensch.”</span> The
First Man is, in the Chinese treatise lately found at Tun-huang in circumstances
to be presently mentioned, identified with the Persian Ormuzd
and the five elements are there declared to be his sons. See Chavannes
and Pelliot, <span lang="fr"><i>Un Traité Manichéen retrouvé en Chine</i></span>, <abbr title='part'>pt</abbr> 1, <i>Journal Asiatique</i>,
série <abbr title='ten'><span class='fss'>X.</span></abbr>, <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'><span class='fss'>XVIII.</span></abbr> (1911), <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 512, 513. The 12 elements which helped in
his formation seem to be mentioned by no other author than En Nadîm.
<abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine, however, <span lang="la"><i>Contra Epistulam Fundamenti</i></span>, <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 13, speaks of
the “12 members of light.” The Tun-huang treatise also mentions “the
12 great kings of victorious form” whom it seems to liken to the 12 hours
of the day. As the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> does the same with the “12 Aeons”
who are apparently the signs of the Zodiac, it is possible that we here have
a sort of super-celestial Zodiac belonging to the Paradise of Light, of which
that in our sky is a copy. It should be remembered that in the Asiatic
cosmogonies the fixed stars belong to the realm of good as the representatives
of order, while the planets or “wanderers” are generally evil.</p>

According to the Christian tradition, the Powers of Darkness devoured
only the soul of the First Man which was left below when his body, as will
presently be seen, returned to the upper world. See Hegemonius, <i>Acta</i>,
<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'><span class='fss'>VII.</span></abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 10, Beeson.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1053'>1053</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Both the Christian and the Mahommedan traditions agree as to this
result of the fight, which is paralleled not only by the more or leas successful
attempt of Jaldabaoth and his powers to <i>eat</i> the light of Pistis Sophia,
but also by a similar case in orthodox Zoroastrianism. For all these see
Cumont, <i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 18, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 4. Bar Khôni (Pognon, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 186), goes
further and describes the surrender of the First Man as a tactical effort
on his part, “as a man who having an enemy puts poison in a cake and
gives it to him.” Alexander of Lycopolis (<i>adv. Manich.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='three'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>), on the other
hand declares that God could not avenge himself upon matter (as he calls
Darkness) as he wished, because he had no evil at hand to help him, “since
evil does not exist in the house and abode of God”; that he therefore
sent the soul into matter which will eventually permeate it and be the death
of it; but that in the meantime the soul is changed for the worse and
participates in the evil of matter, “as in a dirty vessel the contents suffer
change.” These, however, are more likely to be the ideas of the Christian
accusers than the defences of the Manichaean teachers.</p>

Kessler points out, En Nadîm gives two accounts doubtless taken from
different Manichaean sources. In one, he says simply that the King of
the Paradise of Light followed with other gods and delivered the First
Man, the actual victor over Darkness being called “the Friend” of the
Lights (like Mithras). He then goes on to say that Joy (<i>i.e.</i> the Mother
of Life) and the Spirit of Life went to the frontier, looked into the abyss
of hell and saw the First Man and his powers were held enlaced by Satan,
“the Presumptuous Oppressor and the Life of Darkness”; then she called
him in a loud and clear voice, and he became a god, after which he returned
and “cut the roots of the Dark Powers.” For Bar Khôni’s amplification
of this story see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 302, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1, and <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_324'>324</a> <i>infra</i>. The whole of this, together
with the cutting of the roots, is strongly reminiscent of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>.</p>

The <i>Acta</i> (Hegemonius, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 11, Beeson) say that the “Living
Spirit” before mentioned “created the Cosmos, descended clothed with
three other powers, drew forth the rulers (οἱ ἄρχοντες) and crucified them
in the firmament which is their body the Sphere.” “Then he created the
lights (φωστῆρες) which are the remnants of the soul, caused the firmament
to encompass them, and again created the earth [not the Cosmos] with
its eight aspects.” The Latin version after “earth” adds “they (<i>sic!</i>) are
eight.” which if it refers to the aspects would agree with En Nadîm. Alexander
of Lycopolis (<i>adv. Manich.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='three'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>), who had been a follower of Manes
and was a Christian bishop some 25 years after Manes’ death, says that
“God sent forth another power which we call the Demiurge or creator
of all things; that this Demiurge in creating the Cosmos separated from
matter as much power as was unstained, and from it made the Sun and
Moon; and that the slightly stained matter became the stars and the
expanse of heaven.” “The matter from which the Sun and Moon were
taken,” he goes on to say, “was cast out of the Cosmos and resembles
night” [Qy the Outer Darkness?], while the rest of the “elements” consists
of light and matter unequally mingled. Bar Khôni (Pognon, <i>op. cit.</i>
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 188), as will presently be seen, says that the Living Spirit with the Mother
of Life and two other powers called the Appellant and Respondent [evidently
the “three other powers” of the <i>Acta</i>] descended to earth, caused
the Rulers or Princes to be killed and flayed, and that out of their skins
the Mother of Life made 11 heavens, while their bodies were cast on to
the earth of darkness and made 8 earths. The Living Spirit then made
the Sun, the Moon, and “thousands of Lights” (<i>i.e.</i> Stars) out of the light
he took from the Rulers. That this last story is an elaboration of the
earlier ones seems likely, and the flaying of the Rulers seems to be reminiscent
of the Babylonian legend of Bel and Tiamat, an echo of which is also
to be found in the later Avestic literature. See West, <i>Pahlavi Texts</i>
(<abbr class='spell'>S.B.E.</abbr>), <abbr title='part'>pt</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 243. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Cumont, <i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 27, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 2.</p>

This would agree perfectly with the system of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, where it
is said that the “receivers of the Sun and Moon” give the particles of the
light as it is won from matter to Melchizedek, the purifier, who purifies
it before taking it into the Treasure-house (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 36, 37, Copt.). The idea
that the Sun’s rays had a purifying effect shows shrewd observation of
nature before his bactericidal power was discovered by science. So does
the association of the Moon with water, which doubtless came from the
phenomenon of the tides. Is the Column of Glory the Milky Way?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1057'>
<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1057'>1057</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The Ecpyrosis or final conflagration is always present in orthodox
Mazdeism, where it inspires its Apocalypses, and is in effect the necessary
conclusion to the drama which begins with the assault on the world of
light by Ahriman. For references, see Söderblom, <i>op. cit.</i> chap. <abbr title='four'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr>
From the Persians it probably passed to the Stoics and thus reached the
Western world slightly in advance of Christianity. “The day when the
Great Dragon shall be judged” is continually on the lips of the authors
of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and the Μέρος τευχῶν Σωτῆρος, and the conception
may therefore have reached Manes from two sources at once. The angels
maintaining the world as mentioned in the text are of course the Splenditenens
and Omophorus about to be described.</p>

<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 10) mentions the Wheel briefly and rather obscurely. It seems
to have fallen out of the account of Bar Khôni. But see the Tun-huang
treatise (Chavannes et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> 1<sup>ère</sup> partie, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 515, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 2, 516, 517, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 3).
There can be little doubt that it is to be referred to the Zodiac. The Aeons
of the Light seem to be the five worlds who here play the part of the
Parastatae in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1059'>

but not Splenditenens. Splenditenens is, however, well known to <abbr title='saint'>St</abbr>
Augustine, who describes him (<i>contra Faustum</i>, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'><span class='fss'>XV.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 7) as <span lang="la"><i>Splenditenentem
magnum, sex vultus et ora ferentem, micantemque lumine</i></span>, “Great
Splenditenens, bearing six faces and mouths, and glittering with light.”
So later (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 9) he says, <span lang="la"><i>Splenditenentem, reliquias eorumdem
membrorum Dei vestri in manu habentem, et cetera omnia capta, oppressa,
inquinata plangentem, et Atlantem maximum subter humeris suis cum eo
ferentem, ne totum ille fatigatus abjiciat</i></span>. “Splenditenens, who has in his
hand the remains of these members of your God [<i>i.e.</i> the five elements or
‘sons’ of the First Man] and who mourns the capture and oppression and
defilement of all the rest; and huge Atlas, who bears everything with him on
his shoulders, lest he should be wearied and cast it away.” Bar Khôni
(Pognon, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 188, 189) describes them both, and calls Splenditenens “the
Ornament of Splendour,” while he makes the pair two of the five sons of
the Living Spirit, as more clearly appears in the Tunhuang treatise (Chavannes
et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 549, and notes 2 and 5). Where Manes found
the figure of Splenditenens is not apparent, but the world-bearing angel is
an old conception in Western Asia, as <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont has shown in his before-quoted
<i>Cosmogonie Manichéenne</i>, App. <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> He appears prominently on the

Moon were formed out of that part of the light (here called δύναμις
“power”), which, although it had been captured by the powers of matter,
had not been contaminated, while that which had suffered some slight
and moderate stain became the stars and sky. The <i>Acta</i> (Hegemonius,
<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 11, Beeson), as we have seen, says that the Living Spirit
created the lights (φωστῆρες, luminaria), which are the remnants of the soul

that she had any connection with the “Virgin of Light” of the <i>Pistis

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1066'>1066</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This Mother of Life is one of the most prominent, though not one of
the most active figures in the Manichaean pantheon. Her identification
with the Spirit of the Right Hand or first Power created by the Supreme
God of Light has been mentioned above (note 1, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_293'>293</a> <i>supra</i>). She doubtless
has her immediate origin in the great mother goddess worshipped throughout
Western Asia, whose most familiar name is Cybele, but whom we have
seen (<abbr title='chapter'>Chap.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <i>supra</i>) identified with Isis, Demeter, and all the goddesses
of the Hellenistic pantheon. See as to this, Bousset, <i>Hauptprobleme</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr>
58 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>, although he, too, falls into the error of identifying with her the
Virgin of Light of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>. That the name “Mother of Life”
at least passed to all these goddesses is certain; but it also found its way
into Egyptian Christianity; for in the Coptic spell or amulet known as
the <i>Prayer of the Virgin in Bartos</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Parthia), studied by Mr <abbr class='spell'>W. E.</abbr> Crum
(<abbr class='spell'><i>P.S.B.A.</i></abbr> <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'><span class='fss'>XIX.</span></abbr> 1897, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 216), the Virgin Mary is represented as saying
“I am Mariham (Μαριάμ), I am Maria, I am the Mother of the Life of the
whole World!”, and the popularity of the “Prayer” is shown by its
frequent appearance in Ethiopic and Arabic versions (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 211).
So, too, in the evidently Christian <i>Trattato Gnostico</i> of <abbr class='spell'>F.</abbr> Rossi (<span lang="it"><i>Memorie
della Reale Accademia di Torino</i></span>, ser. <abbr title='two'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-three'>xliii.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 16) the magician says
“I entreat thee, O God, by the great revered Virgin (παρθένος) in whom the
Father was concealed from the beginning before He had created anything.”
Bar Khôni, again (Pognon, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 209-211), speaks of the Kukeans, who
seem to have been a semi-Christian sect, and who taught that the coming
of Jesus to earth had for its object the redemption of His bride, the Mother
of Life, who was detained here below, like the Helena of Simon Magus.
Mother of Life is mentioned in all the Mahommedan and Christian
writers who have treated of Manichaeism (for the references, see Chavannes
et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> 1<sup>ère</sup> partie, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 511, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1), in the Pahlavi <abbr title='manuscript'>MS.</abbr> discovered by
the Germans at Turfan (<abbr class='spell'>F. W. K.</abbr> Muller, <span lang="de"><i>Handschriften-Reste in Estrangelo-Schrift</i></span>,
<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 47, 55), and in the Chinese treatise from Tun-huang
(Chavannes et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 511 <i>et al.</i>). In this last, she is called
Chan-mou, which is translated “the Excellent Mother,” and En Nadîm
in one passage (Kessler, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 399; Flügel, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 100) calls
her Nahnaha, which Flügel would translate “The Aversion of the Evil
Ones.” It should be noticed, however, that her part in the cosmogony
is small, and that she acts upon the world, like all these supercelestial
powers, only through her descendants or “sons.” These are treated
of later (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_323'>323</a> and <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_302'>302</a> <i>infra</i>). Titus of Bostra as quoted
by Flügel, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 210, speaks of her as δύναμις τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ οὐκέτι
φῶς αἰσθητὸν ἀλλ’ ὡς ἂν φαίη προβολὴ τοῦ θεοῦ. “[The] Power of the
Good One, no longer a perceptible light, but as if one should say, an emanation
of God.” Some years ago, we could hardly have looked for her
prototype or first appearance in the history of religions in any other
direction than Babylonia, where the worship of Ishtar, her Babylonian
counterpart, goes back as far as we can trace Babylonian religion. Now,
however, it is plain that other races than the Babylonians may have been
concerned in the spread of the worship of the Great Mother throughout
Western Asia. In the Zoroastrian faith, she seems to appear as Spenta
Armaiti, the one certainly female power among the seven Amshaspands,
who in the Pahlavi texts is set over the earth, as Vohu Mano is made
protector of the beasts, Asha Vahishta of the fire, and Khshathra Vairya
is set over metals. But besides this, she is identified in the Gâthâs with
the Wisdom of God (for references see <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 136-137 of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Carnoy’s article
in the <i>Muséon</i> mentioned below), an identification which Plutarch (<i>de Is.
et Os.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-seven'><span class='fss'>XLVII.</span></abbr>) admits by translating her name as σοφία, and like the Sophia
of the Gnostics is given as a spouse to her creator Ahura Mazda, to whom
she bears the First Man Gayômort (Darmesteter, <i>Le Zend-Avesta</i>, <abbr class='spell'>t.</abbr> <abbr title='one'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>
<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 128-129). Yet we now know that this figure may have come into the
Zoroastrian pantheon neither from Semitic sources nor, as Darmesteter
thought, from Plato. <abbr class='spell'>M. A.</abbr> Carnoy in a study called <i>Armaiti-Ârmatay</i>
(<i>Muséon</i>, <abbr class='spell'>n.s.</abbr> <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'><span class='fss'>XIII.</span></abbr> (1912), <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 127-146) shows the identity of the
Persian Amshaspand with the Vedic goddess Aramati. We have already
seen that the Vedic gods Varuna and Mitra were worshipped by Hittites
in Asia Minor before the <abbr title='twelfth'><span class='fss'>XII</span>th</abbr> century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and Prof. Garstang believes
that the Earth-Mother was the great goddess of the Hittites, and was the
one worshipped in Roman times at Hierapolis or Mabug as the <i>Dea Syria</i>
or Atargatis, a name that he equates with Derceto, the mother of Semiramis
in classic legend, and declares to be compounded of Ishtar or Astarte
and the Aramaic “Athar or Athe.” See Strong and Garstang, <i>The Syrian
Goddess</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 1-8, and notes 24, 25, and 30, on <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 52, 53 and 30 <i>op.

from an Aryan rather than from a Semitic original.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='label'><a href='#r1067'>1067</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This Living Spirit is the most active agent of the Light in the Manichaean
system, and seems to have held his place unaltered through all the
changes of Manichaean teaching. Alexander of Lycopolis (<i>contra Manich.</i>
<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='three'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>) speaks of him as the Δημιουργός or Architect of the Universe. The
earliest part of the <i>Acta</i> (Hegemonius, <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'><span class='fss'>VII.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 10, Beeson) says that he was
put forth from the Father (or Supreme God of Light) in consequence of
the prayers of the First Man after his defeat, that he delivered this last,
crucified or bound the Archons in the firmament (as Jeû is said to have
done in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>), made the Sun and Moon and appointed their
courses, and further made the eight earths. <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine, <i>contra Faustum</i>,
<abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 1, makes the Manichaean Faustus call him the “Third Majesty
whom we acknowledge to have his seat and his lodging-place in the whole
circle of the atmosphere. From whose powers and spiritual inpouring
also, the earth conceived and brought forth the suffering Jesus who is the
life and salvation of men and is hanging on every tree.” <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine
further speaks (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 9) of “your mighty (<span lang="la"><i>potentem</i></span> for <span lang="la"><i>viventem</i></span>)
Spirit, who constructs the world from the captive bodies of the race of
darkness or rather from the members of your God held in subjection and
bondage.” <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine (see <i>contra Faustum</i>, <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'><span class='fss'>XV.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 6) also knows
that the Living Spirit has, like the First Man, five sons, to whom we shall
return later. The Mahommedan writers have much less to say on the
subject. En Nadîm (Kessler, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 390; Flügel, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 88) says
abruptly that “Joy [<i>i.e.</i> the Mother of Life] and the Spirit of Life went to
the frontier, looked into the abyss of hell and saw there the First Man and
his angels,” whereupon the Spirit of Life called the First Man with a voice
of thunder and the latter “became a god.” This story is so without
connection with the context that Kessler is probably right in attributing
it to another source from that from which the <i>Fihrist</i> has drawn up to
this point. The source in question was probably a late one; for Bar
Khôni (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 186-188) supplies many more details which will be given
in the text. Bar Khôni also amplifies the story in the <i>Fihrist</i> into a
description of how the Living Spirit, on seeing the First Man in the Darkness,
spoke “a word which took the appearance of a pointed sword” (<abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr>
Revelation <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 16), and how this word caused to appear the image of the
First Man. A dialogue then ensues between apparently the sword and
the image, which appear to be here identified with the Appellant and
Respondent of later Manichaeism, and the pair are drawn up out of hell.
See Cumont, <i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 24, and note 5. Al Bîrûnî, <i>Chronology</i>,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 190, also knows of the Spirit of Life and says that Manes “preached”
of him. In the Turfan texts there is occasional mention of the “Spirit”
together with the Father and the Son (Müller, <i>Handschriften-Reste</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 26,
28), and also of the “commands” of the Holy Spirit to the Hearers, which
are plainly allusions to the Living Spirit or Ζῶν Πνεῦμα of the Christian
Fathers. In the Tun-huang treatise (Chavannes et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 510,
556) he is repeatedly mentioned, and although nothing is said of his
demiurgic or world-creating powers, the part which he and the Mother of
Life play in the rescue of the First Man after his defeat is recognized, and
he is spoken of as forming the third person of a Trinity of which the two
other members are the Father or highest God of Light and the “Son of
the Light.” Finally (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 557), he is said to be “a white dove,”
whereby his likeness to the Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity already
noted by Faustus is emphasized (see Augustine, <i>ubi cit. supra</i> and <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr>
<abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 6).</p>

to suppose that one or other predominates in the soul of everyone. Hence
probably the degree in the Manichaean hierarchy to which any hearer

had already figured to themselves their King of the Paradise of Light as
existing in the three Persons of Father, Mother, and Son in the shape of
the Light, the Mother of Life and the First Man. This Trinity corresponds
in every particular with that worshipped in Asia Minor under the names of
Zeus (or Hadad), Cybele, and Atys, at Eleusis as Dionysos, Demeter, and
Iacchos, in Greek Egypt as Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and in Persia, according
to <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont, as Ormuzd, Spenta Armaiti, and Gayômort. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> Bousset,
<span lang="de"><i>Hauptprobleme</i></span>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 333-337. That its origin can be traced, as the last-named
author seems to think, to the Babylonian Triad, Ea, Damkina, and
Marduk, is more doubtful. The Manichaeans really acknowledged, as they
were never tired of affirming, only two gods, Light and Darkness, and
considered all the lesser powers of Light, including man’s soul, as formed
from God’s “substance.” When, therefore, they spoke of trinities,
tetrads, and so on, it was in all probability for the purpose of producing
that show of outward conformity with other religions which was one of the
most marked features of their system.</p>

substitute Reason for Knowledge and Will for Feeling. The Greek names
as given in the <i>Acta</i> (Hegemonius, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'><span class='fss'>X.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 15, Beeson) are νοῦς,
ἔννοια, φρόνησις, ἐνθύμησις, λογισμός which the Latin translator makes into
<span lang="la"><i>mens</i>, <i>sensus</i>, <i>prudentia</i>, <i>intellectus</i>, <i>cogitatio</i></span>. The first of these may pass
as correct, since Nous appears as the first emanation of the Highest
God in all the systems which preceded that of Manes and from which he
is likely to have copied. Of the rest, it can only be said that they are
the translations by scribes of Syriac or Mandaite words which were ill
calculated to express metaphysical abstractions, and that their copyists
were seldom well acquainted with the etymology of any of the three
languages. Hence they generally made use of what they thought were
the corresponding expressions in the works of great heresiologists like
Irenaeus and Hippolytus without troubling themselves much as to their
appropriateness. In the passage from the <i>Acta</i> above quoted, the five
qualities named are said to be the “names of the soul,” which is explained
by what is said later (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'><span class='fss'>X.</span></abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 17, Beeson) that “the air (ἀήρ) is
the soul of men and beasts and birds and fish and creeping things.” En
Nadîm (Kessler, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 387; Flügel, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 86), as has been said on <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_291'>291</a>
<i>supra</i>, gives the “members of the air” as Gentleness, Knowledge, Intelligence,
Discretion and Discernment, which are the same as those which
he has just attributed to the King of the Paradise of Light. <abbr title='Saint'>St</abbr> Augustine
(<i>c. Faust.</i> <abbr title='book'>Bk</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></abbr> <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 15) says in like manner that the Manichaeans thought
their souls “members of God,” which seems to refer to the same belief.
Bar Khôni (Pognon, <i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 186), as has been said, not only assigns the
five dwellings of Intelligence, Knowledge, Thought, Reflexion and Feeling
to the Living Spirit, but makes him draw his five sons from them, and
<abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Cumont (<i>Cosmog. Manich.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 10, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 3) quotes the <i>Acta Thomae</i> as saying
that the Third Legate or Srôsh is “the Legate of the five members, Nous,
Ennoia, Phronesis, Enthymesis and Logismos.” From all which we may
gather that the Supreme God of Light and his “Second” and “Third”
creations were each alike thought to have the same five dwellings or
hypostases consisting of abstract qualities, although the exact significance
of the names given to them for the present escapes us.</p>

<abbr class='spell'>MM.</abbr> Chavannes and Pelliot (<i>op. cit.</i> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 521, <abbr title='note'>n.</abbr> 1) think it possible that they
may represent the portions of the “armour” of the First Man which were

MM. Chavannes and Pelliot explain] of the great fire, and the guardian of
the Ether, and of the air, and of the water, and of the inner living fire,
abide near the lesser light until the fire has consumed the whole Cosmos.
But for how many years I have not learned.” The Latin version runs:
<span lang="la"><i>Prolationes autem omnes Jesus in modica navi, et mater vitae et duodecim
gubernatores et virgo lucis et senior tertius. Unde et majori in navi vivens
spiritus adhibetur, et murus ignis illius magni, et murus venti et aeris et
aquae et interioris ignis vivi, quae omnia in luna habitabunt usquequo totum
mundum ignis absumat; in quot autem annis numerum non didici</i></span>:—which
appears to be nonsense. The number of years which Turbo, who is here
speaking, had not learned, is said by En Nadîm to be 1468.</p>

this Messenger was added to the two triads (of Father, Mother, and Son,
and the Friend of the Lights, Great Ban, and Living Spirit, respectively) in
order to make up “the sacred number of seven.” But seven is a number
singularly neglected by the Manichaeans, who paid the greatest reverence
to five, and preferred to seven the three and the twelve. Nor do I think
that there is any real parallel in Manichaeism to the Seven Amshaspands
of Zoroastrianism. The actual word <i>amshaspand</i> is used in the Tun-huang
treatise (Chavannes et Pelliot, <i>op. cit.</i> 1<sup>ère</sup> ptie, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 544), but with an entirely

Has it any connection with the Sanskrit <i>vasanta</i> “spring”? In that case,
the 50 days fast may have been continuous like the Christian Lent and
the Mahommedan Ramadan. But it seems more likely that it refers to
the weekly fast on Sunday which, the <i>Fihrist</i> notwithstanding, seems to
have been incumbent on all the Manichaeans, Elect and Hearers alike.

is almost tempted to see in it a corruption of the Yom Kippur or Day of
Atonement of the Jews. Judaism is the last religion from which the
Manichaeans would have consciously borrowed; but the Jews have
always taken their goods where they found them, and it may well be that
both Jews and Manichaeans were here drawing from a common source.</p>
